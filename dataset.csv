"Alcatel One Touch Fierce 2, 4GB, 5"" Screen, Unlocked","Alcatel","118.99","2","I bought many phones of this model for friends and for my use. All of them were working perfect at the first months. Couple of months later problems came with them. Mine one used to restart during phone conversations. Contact and other applicaions give error and I have to close them. Alarm mode does not works. If I try a phone call it takes long to beep or dialing. Not factory unlocked to uninstall app not needed. I had the first model and GPS works great, this one not. So I would not recomend this model. The big problem looks like to be a model manufactured exclusively for T-Mobil and Metro PCS. If they are used out from USA there are not posibilities to update when updates are available. I have done root and any how the same problem with update. My last problem at the time.","0","unhelpful"

I will own the metal zenwatch and this phone for a total of $400 bucks, think about that. You will spend about $1,000 on a note 5 & gear s2 combo.

"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Gold (U.S. Warranty) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","Asus","225","5","This phone is all about doing more for much less. I really like Asus software and features that you might not get even in some higher end phones. But as you would expected from a typical mid-range phone, this phone would handle all your daily needs easily and a bit more. It is not a perfect phone, given a less-than-good camera and a dimmer screen. But by no mean they are bad or below average, they are just not the best I've seen (comparing with Samsung Note 4, LG G4 lines). Honestly, I couldn't even see the difference if i don't have those higher ends to compare to. You can find plenty of good reviews about this phone out there. I thought, why spend a lot more for a device that can give you the same performance in just 3, 4 years life span. Overall, I'm enjoying using this phone and happy that didn't have to pay more.","0","unhelpful"

"DASH HTC s620 s621 UNLOCKED WI-FI WORLD PHONE S 620","HTC","14.44","3","I did a lot of research before I bought this phone. I am with T-mobile and didn't have good reception with my old phone so I decided to get a new one. I read good reviews about good signal with this phone. It works OK, signal is better than my old phone had but sometimes it is not too clear sound at another side when you talk. Be aware that this phone comes with charger only (no accessories like USB cable, manual or headset). I downloaded Dash manual from the Internet and it says that a new phone comes with those 3 accessories so I called to Amazon help and was told that I can return the item for a full refund. Battery is OK but phone needs to be charged daily even if wi-fi/ the Internet off and you don't talk too much during a day.","0","unhelpful"
"DASH HTC s620 s621 UNLOCKED WI-FI WORLD PHONE S 620","HTC","14.44","3","I honestly love this phone. The keyboard is very small to fit all the keys in but you get used to typing with it after a few days. It can be a little slow moving sometimes, as this is one of the earliest Windows phones. The biggest con to getting this one is the fact that the screen breaks VERY easily. I've gone through three of these this way. It breaks on the inside and the screen goes all white.","0","unhelpful"

It worked wonderfully, I took very good care of this phone because of how nice it was. Then after owning it and using it for about 4 months it just died on me out of nowhere. There was no indication that the phone was going bad, nothing. It was working just fine. Before I knew it, it just wouldn't turn on. It just sits there not doing anything and I can't do anything about it. As you may not know this is an Internal phone, so you can not take the battery out as there is no battery cover. I feel helpless now because I used this phone for my job and now I can't get any of my information off of my phone. So basically I am screwed for the next month or so. Thank you HTC.","0","unhelpful"

"HTC 8X 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Dual-Core Windows 8 Smartphone - Lime Yellow - AT&T - No Warranty","HTC","54.99","2","I hate buying phones online because you can't be too sure of what you're going to get. I bought the phone with high hopes because my iPhone was taking a crap. When I ordered this phone, I was expecting to get a package in the mail containing a brand new, in the box phone ready to be activated with the books that would normally come with it. But that's not what I got. The phone came wrapped in a plastic bag placed inside a plastic container containing simply just the phone, a charger, and a sticker with the order number and such on it. I was very disappointed. But that's not the only thing that upset me. When it came time to activate the phone, I was on the phone with Verizon for an hour and 19 minutes trying to activate it. The Verizon representative told me that the phone was not registered with Verizon. I was furious. We did however get it registered and activated and I've been using it for about a week. I like the phone itself overall but this specific phone has glitches when I'm in a call. It will randomly end calls, or when I'm in a call the screen won't shut off like its supposed to when I hold it to my ear, causing me to press buttons with my face. I could ramble on and on about the phone but I'm going to leave it at that and just say that I would not recommend anybody to buy this specific phone from this specific seller.","0","unhelpful"

"Huawei Ascend G300 Unlocked Phone - U.S. Warranty (Silver)","Huawei","206.94","1","I always like to give a product some time before I write a review on it. It's been 8 months since I bought this phone. I hate it. The power button works only sometimes. So, there will be times when you can't turn on the phone and cannot make a phone call. If you are in an emergency, you won't be able to reach anyone and you may die because of that. The phone, when it can be turned on, takes FOREVER to load a webpage. The touch screen is not sensitive. The battery needs to be recharged every day even if you don't use the phone. You will have many dropped calls. When the phone thinks you have talked enough, it will cut off your conversation and you have to call again to continue your conversation. Language input methods includes only English and Spanish. The picture of the phone on Amazon doesn't show the back of the phone. I thought it was all silver, but the back of the phone is white. The earphones broke within a week. These are enough reasons for you to not buy this phone. I have had enough and decided to write a review on it.","0","unhelpful"
"Huawei Ascend G300 Unlocked Phone - U.S. Warranty (Silver)","Huawei","206.94","5","What you see is what you get. That's simply. IMHO this is the best phone at its price range, you get all the features of pricey phones. So what's the catch? Limited RAM. That means more apps you run in background, more slow the phone will get, even unresponsive. I managed to run whatsapp, facebook messenger, google hangout, instagram, skype and twitter, sadly facebook is too heavy so I decided to disable it. Responsiveness improved a lot after I installed Open Advanced Task app, it kills unnecessary process and keeps some room on RAM. That's it.","0","unhelpful"

Its like having an iphone and an android at the same timee. It does carry two SIM ports but the first port I couldnt fit my micro SIM card from family mobilee. Its moree for just a memory card. On the secoond port I put my sim card. It fit perfectly and once turned on it was working. Same with my boyfriends phone. Since his is metro pcs once he put the sim card on the huawei he needed to call customer service to switch thee service to that phonee. After that everything has been working nicely. It has a nice grip and touch. And the display is awesome. It has tons of options in the settings and it has like 10GB of free space. Even thoo it says 16GB -__- the camera is amazing. And the froont camera has selfie and filter options that are really cool. Just the design inside aand out is awesoome. My boyfriend got it in black and I got it in white.

I bought it as a replacement for my THL phone. I fell into the water with the THL. I was in water for at least two to three minutes with the THL turned on. dry it out and it worked, but have water between the screen. Worked for another month. Then I bought the Lenovo thinking hat it will be water proof. Used it. Went kayaking with it. OK, good. But then one day I went paddle boarding and fell into the water. I fell in and got back on the Paddleboard in less than a minute, but this time water got in. In less then a minute, the screen was dead, and it got very warm. RIP. Dead. I figured out that I didn't press the flap that covered the USB charger port in tight enough, but come on, a cheap THL survived for a month after going in the water for over a minute and this LENOVO completely died in water for less than a minute. They need to work on the flap seal.","0","unhelpful"

I ordered from Trust&Best which sells this phone pre-installed with Google Play Store and through the Amazon Fulfillment Service (meaning Amazon deals with the shipping & returns on their orders). I liked aspects about the phone but ended up returning it for a full refund minus cost of return shipping. Refund process was thankfully a breeze.Testing out the Lenovo S8 S898T with T-Mobile, I had no issues sending and receiving texts and phone calls. The WiFi also worked perfectly well. My biggest issue came with the data which was unbearably slow/nearly nonexistent. I did manage to receive about three incoming Skype messages and one text from a texting app (all sent to me by my sister in the same room), but this was few of numerous msgs and calls we sent via data & WiFi, most of which were not received. I also tried to send msgs on this Lenovo phone via data from another location... none were received until I connected to WiFi later.Testing the GPS, it would only locate my current location maybe 1/4 of the time, was often slow to determine a route, and almost always immediately lost signal upon beginning its suggested routes. In the rare times it directed me in real time, it was inaccurate about where I was or was going (and only successfully navigated me around my neighborhood once). Decent GPS navigation is absolutely essential to me, so I was disappointed when I realized this feature was completely unreliable. Data functioned better on my previous and current phone.ASIDE from the data... nearly everything else about this phone, I liked. My sister thought it looked ""cheap."" Personally, I liked the look and feel, as well as its light weight. Just like another reviewer mentioned though, the back panel (that pops out for battery/sim insert) feels very, very flimsy and cheap. I was so scared I'd snap it. However, I still liked the overall look and popping open and shut the back panel probably isn't something you need to do very often anyway.The screen was clear, bright, responsive. Pretty much looks just as it does in the pics. A few Chinese apps are scattered here and there, plus some notifications appear in Chinese but I knew that ordering the phone as it is a Chinese phone, thus geared towards Chinese consumers. This wasn't a big deal to me and may or may not be to you too.Video Quality: average to below-average. This might really depend on the person asked. I'm used to very crisp video, so my standard might be high. I might've liked it a little better if the screen were smaller.Camera--hmm. Perhaps I was expecting too much (or perhaps I didn't know how to use the camera adjustments properly...), but I didn't really like it. The pictures are often too bright and not very crisp. They look alright every now and again but most of the time was a struggle to look realistic. I did sort of like it more than my iPhone 4 camera though.I'm not sure what else to review at the moment. Overall, I liked the size, feel, lightness, screen. Camera was okay, video quality left something to be desired, and the data barely worked. I might've just stuck with this phone anyway, if it weren't for the data issues.I feel like I can only recommend this phone if, for whatever reason, you feel very positive about it working with your plan in your location. Or if you're just looking to send regular calls and SMS texts via T-Mobile (I didn't test and therefore cannot comment on other carriers), as well as use WiFi. After reading tens of reviews, it does seem like some people have struck luck with data on this phone, but it also seems like a crapshoot, so do a lot of research. Otherwise, I can't strongly recommend this phone to US users, and would advise looking into other similarly-priced, but perhaps more reliable (for US users) brands like BLU. I'm still a fan of Lenovo though, and can't wait for their phones to enter the US market.","0","unhelpful"

"Lenovo S850 Smartphone Android 4.4 Glass Shell 5.0 Inch HD Gorilla Glass 16GB (Blue)","Lenovo","124.25","2","The phone worked beautifully to start with and I was beginning to think that it was a good thing I had not followed the reviews. However, using the phone for about seven months the touch screen has stopped working.First it was the three buttons at the bottom of the screen: the home, back and menu buttons. I was able to find a way around this through an app which limited the use of the phone but still gave me control of the back and home capabilities.However, after about two weeks of that the lack of responsiveness in the touch started to spread further up the screen.I am severely disappointed since Lenova has such a good reputation in pc's and I was enjoying the use of the phone during the time it was working. I was so enthused with it that I bought another one as a gift. When it works, it is a great phone but now I am so discouraged that I think I will never buy another one.","0","unhelpful"

As it turns, not quite.Besides RAM difference from the 2GB RAM model, there are few unexpected surprises.When watching YouTube videos about this phone I have noticed that in the package with the phone it should be OTG cable and noise-canceling earphones. Well, there aren`t in the package that I have received.What attracted me in the first place was the titanium look, and in this aspect I am more than pleased. Not only it looks excellent, but the texture of the back of the phone doesn`t show fingerprints. The sound is best I have had in any phone. The cameras are decent.What I appreciate is that the language settings were set for my location and the charger came with an appropriate adapter.Update 29 January 2016: after five months in use the screen started losing responsiveness; the power button is also non responsive, unless pressed with excessive force; there are numerous software glitches.

Relatively recent android OS version, great power to play games or play videos, responses to commands are very fast, plenty of storage space, cameras galore and good resolution with plenty of features. So, so pleased at this purchase. The screen is the perfect size for toddlers to watch movies in the car or play toddler apps.My only disappointment is that the speakers point directly out the back, making it a little hard to hear especially when using a flap fold case as a stand.","0","unhelpful"

It did not have any seal! And even the back lid has some finger spots. No adapter has been sent for US use, but a travel adapter is sent, guessing that is because it is marked as an international Version ? It does not work with Micro SIM which I thought it would as per the reviews I read. It is running on old version of OS. Anyway, overall still a good phone for the amount I paid for it. It's a phablet and still so cheap which is the reason I bought it. Three star mostly because of the packaging flaws.","0","unhelpful"

The screen seemed to give a sharp picture, the screen size was very nice and the phone was very thin. After a week, the picture started flickering and became dull at times. It would improve as I used the phone, but it happened constantly and I would have to use the phone for fifteen minutes for the picture to become crisp again. The battery life is terrible. It would go from 100% down to 70% in a couple hours without even using the phone.......much quicker if the phone is used. I was constantly charging it. The camera isn't any better than the 8mp iPhone camera, which was disappointing. The antenna wasn't very good.........I didn't get very good coverage at my house with this phone but got coverage with another phone under the same service. The gps is terrible.

Got another screen that worked fine for a few weeks and then the problem showed up yet again.

"LG G2 D800 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE 2.26 GHz Quad-Core Android Smartphone with 13 MP Camera (White)","LG","199.99","4","I really like this phone. Very smooth operation and fast. Some complain about the buttons on the back but I got used to them in one day and prefer them there. It's so easy to press a side mounted button by accident. The phone is very fast and smooth. The first one I received had a microphone problem. Worked on speakerphone but not in regular mode. (Even after updating to 5.0.2) Lots of corrosion evident in the earphone socket could be seen with a magnifying glass and light. Also lots of static on the screen. I sent it back (Santa Monica Wireless) since the only recommended fix I didn't try was replacing the microphone which I wasn't going to do on a week old phone. This was obviously a bad phone they sent me. Found another one that is listed as factory refurbished for less money that works perfectly! Bought a second one for my wife. She loves it!","0","unhelpful"

"LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone with 5.2-Inch 32GB H790 4G LTE (Carbon Black)","LG","399","3","I love this phone, but it has some serious quality issues. Within hours of first booting it up, the camera app was reporting problems connecting to the camera, which required at least two reboots to get working again. Within a couple weeks, the problem had grown to the point where the entire phone would even sometimes crash when launching any app that tried to access the camera. To get the camera working again, whether it simply failed or triggered the phone to crash, always took at least two reboots, and sometimes more.Checking around, I found numerous reports of this. Apparently it is a known issue, all the way down to the fact that the first reboot will not return the camera to a working state, but neither LG nor Google has yet figured out how to resolve it. The consensus so far (even from Google) is that you simply must return it to LG and get it replaced under the warranty, as even though this problem is very common it does not affect all instances of the phone. However, since it wasn't happening every time I used the camera, I thought maybe I could just live with the occasional crash and reboot until maybe one day LG would figure out the problem and a firmware update would be released (one has already been released a few months back which apparently helped the issue but didn't fully resolve it). This willingness to live with it for a while was partly inspired by what I was reading about LG's horrendous technical support turn-around time. In retrospect, what I should have done was return it to Amazon for exchange while it was still in the return window.Over the next few weeks, the crashing became more and more frequent. Eventually, this led to the point over the last few days where the phone was crashing and rebooting several times per day and would rarely ever run more than a few hours without a crash and reboot. And at this point, it was now occurring regardless of any attempt to use the camera, so this was likely a new problem as factory resetting the phone had no effect. I had already learned from personal experience and what I had read that a factory reset does not fix the camera issue, but now I was seeing that one didn't fix this apparent non-related crash issue either, so it was easy to rule out this being caused by the OS getting corrupted by all the camera-related crashes. And the camera had all but totally ceased working by this point. The phone was reset to factory a total of seven times over just a couple weeks, but each reset failed to produce any noticeable change in either problem.Finally, the phone totally died. This morning my alarm failed to go off and upon checking I found that the phone was not powered on. And it would not power on, even by a hard reset. Even plugging it in to the charger failed to produce the 'charging' display. Totally dead in every regard, and happened while simply sitting idle overnight.So now I'm stuck dealing with LG's support system. The process to start a repair return is simple enough and is done completely online without ever needing to deal with a support agent, and you have a ready-to-print FedEx return label within minutes. However, the turn-around time to get a replacement phone to leave their facility and begin making its way to you is 3 to 4 weeks from the date they receive the phone you're sending them. Three to four days shipping each way leaves you without a phone for possibly more than five weeks. You send them a phone with a known issue - that they know they can't correct by repair, and must simply issue a replacement - and it still takes them upwards of a month to ship you that replacement. Based on how long this phone is going to be gone, I've now had to order a low-end phone that I can use to cover this absurd delay by LG - which has now added a physical cost to me on top of the hassle of the whole process.With this kind of stated turn-around time, LG seriously needs to be shipping out some kind of loaner phone to people whose original phone is being sent in under warranty. Of course, what they really should do is just get up off of it and start shipping out the replacements within a day or two.At this point, I simply hope that when they get around to sending me a replacement it doesn't also have this problem or some other problem, like the yellow screen issue or a few other quality-related issues I've read about while researching the problems with mine. I really do like the phone, and hope (maybe against the odds) that I get a stable one that works like it should.","0","unhelpful"

"LG Optimus G E970 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Black","LG","449","1","Avoid the AT&T version of this phone! The AT&T LG Optimus G comes with pre-installed AT&T apps that are absolutely terrible. Like mind-blowingly, unbelievably, spectacularly, I-can't-believe-they-shipped-this awful.This would just be a minor annoyance except for the fact that the AT&T Address Book app pops up unexpectedly in the foreground during the common, everyday scenario of viewing your contacts list--and this misbehaving app cannot be disabled or uninstalled without rooting your phone (note: this ""perma-fail"" situation is specific to the LG Optimus G--more recent phones with this pre-installed app/malware allow you to disable AT&T Address Book). To repeat: EVERYT time you go to the Contacts page in the Phone app, after your contacts instantly appear, the phone quickly whisks you away into the completely useless AT&T Address Book (which takes roughly 1 minute to load). If you dismiss or force-close the app, it will just pop up the next time. You can't disable or uninstall the app from Settings or various popular ""cleaner"" apps. Unlike newer models, you can't disable the app from popping up via the secret ""*#*#2666#*#*"". This app will annoy you until the end of time (or until you give up and just root your phone).Hilariously, the most bizarre part is that AT&T Address Book doesn't even work! If you try to set up the redundant syncing of contacts to some AT&T cloud service, the app just closes. I'm truly shocked that this product ever saw the light of day.As a quick aside to AT&T: this piece of software is not a ""value add."" This is taking an already solid, functional system, and bolting on a useless and frustrating distraction. Please put down the mouse and stop ruining Android. Thanks!In summary: save yourself a ton of trouble and buy a non-AT&T phone (or at least a newer model than this one where you can avoid this headache entirely).","0","unhelpful"

Fits nicely in small pockets.+ Fast processor makes for very responsive user interface.+ Great phone and PDA. I have seen several smartphones that are good as one but not the other.Cons:+ Small screen makes keyboard entry very difficult in portrait mode. Landscape mode keyboard input is much more tolerable. Also, there are ""replacement"" keyboards the use predictive analysis to compensate for ""fat fingering"".+ Only runs Android 1.6. Despite numerous web sites that claim it can be upgraded to 2.0, all my efforts to upgrade the phone failed miserably.Unknown:+ 3G or 4G performance. Comments welcome.Summary:Overall, I say this phone rocks as long as you don't mind using Android 1.6.","0","unhelpful"
"LG Optimus GT540 Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Phone with 3 MP Camera, Android OS, Touch Screen, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth--International Version with No US Warranty (Titanium Silver)","LG","65.99","5","Do you want a new flashy phone? This is not it.If you want a practical affordable phone that isn't so basic that you want to cry, then this is the product for you.It is unlocked so you can do what you want with it. It's international so you can use it when you travel and all you need is a local sim card, or roaming on your local card.I have upgraded mine to the most recent official android update (2.1) which is not 4.0 but it's good enough. I do everything on mine from browsing the net, to android apps for chat (nimbuzz, skype) and mail checks - very proficient phone.The only thing is if you are used to iphone or more expensive phones the touch screen reactivity might bother you. This isn't the most expensive type of touch screen it is only so so. Therefore, it requires some patience on your part. I kept trying to pinch zoom and you can't do that on this phone! (Spoilt by my other half's iphone).I have had it for a year and a half and use it every day. The charge is still good for almost a week with minimal use (a few texts and calls in the week). If you use it heavily (like, almost all day checking mail and chatting) the charge might only last you one day but that's pretty normal.All you need is a TPU case from ebay and you will be set.","0","unhelpful"

My phone comes with Android 1.6 still working on how to upgrade it to 2.1UPDATEAfter my initial review the seller called me, apologized for the phone being locked and refunded the cost of the unlock code.

"LG Optimus GT540 Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Phone with 3 MP Camera, Android OS, Touch Screen, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth--International Version with No US Warranty (Titanium Silver)","LG","65.99","5","To whoever has been complaining about this product in the past, whichever vendor that was dishonest is no longer associated with this particular page. The phone I bought was shipped by 'Best N Price' and adhered exactly to the description.I was able to slip my SIM card right into the phone, it charged right up, and it functioned properly. So, to be clear, it's fully unlocked and working on the AT&T network as I type. On Android, I was able to upgrade the OS to 2.1 without much trouble -- the updater did the thing where it stops at 4%, which happens with LG phones sometimes, but I was able to restart it without wrecking the phone. The phone is unquestionably durable as well, because I dropped it onto a wood floor the second day I had it and it didn't break. There was no data loss or cracked screen, and the phone worked like normal when I powered it back on.When you're buying this phone, bear a few things in mind; It's a European phone, so it's probably not going to give you a 3G signal -- and, according to some, it may arrive in a Continental language (although I received a UK version). It's also a couple years old, so it's going to have Android 1.6, and the hardware isn't going to be able to handle more than 2.1. Another reviewer here listed the steps to upgrade it to 2.3, but I'm not risking turning it into a paperweight.All in all, you're getting what you pay for with an Android phone in this price range. It was $89.99 when I ordered it, but it looks like the price has shot up. In any case, it's a great deal for that price, but you have no business expecting it to be as capable as a brand new Galaxy or something. In addition, it's a foreign model like many other unlocked phones being sold online, so you ought to be prepared for that eventuality and understand that's part of the reason it's inexpensive.One more thing: have a microSDHC card for the phone, preferably Class 4. It takes up to 32GB (and not microSDXC; too new), and the memory card is needed for many features like downloads and pictures because the phone has very little internal memory. Almost everybody has a microSD card lying around, but be prepared if you don't -- or have a Class 2, since that'll probably be too slow -- because there are plenty of good deals for the high capacity Class 4s on this site.","0","unhelpful"

"Microsoft Lumia 640 XL LTE Dual Sim Black 8GB (RM-1096) Unlocked international model- no warranty","LG","255.99","3","2 demerits: Can no longer send group texts with Windows 10. Some features work better following upgrade from 8.1. a few other hiccups in the upgrade. (8.1 was standard when I bought the phone.). And, can no longer complete a forward or reply action with the built-in Outlook App.I bought the phone a few months ago. One of the strong drivers with the wide range of frequency bands this phone is able to handle. I want it for traveling outside US borders, and this one covers quite a few countries. After getting more familiar with Microsoft's way of doing things, I've found the phone and software to be of high quality throughout. Very few quirks for the things I use. Some have workarounds, some not. Sound quality is excellent. As I put the phone to my face, the screen switches out, avoiding accidental disconnect. When I pull the phone away to look at it, the screen comes back right where it was when the call started. It's easy to switch off SIM1 or SIM2 if you are in a location where you don't want them active. It's also possible to independently control the extent of roaming (several extra options when you get Windows 10.(More +) Ability to get 4G data on either SIM (I've not found any phone that can handle data from two sources at once) is a plus. But whichever one you prefer for 4G, the other becomes restricted to 2G. TIPS: (a) Over my 3 month's ownership, I've discovered that selecting higher than 2G on one SIM over the other, can affect what kind the quality of connection you get on both, for example 3G on SimA and 2G on SimB can get you different bar levels than if 2G on SimA and 4G on SimB. You'll have to experiment and YMMV. (b) Turn on ONLY the SIM you want to establish your data connection, leaving the other off until you verify data comes through (turn wi-fi off while testing this). For one of my carrier's I've had to reboot several times, to get it to match up the settings with the signal. After that, you can turn on the other SIM and things should be fine.(More+) When I bought the phone with Windows 8.1 I verified it was upgradable to Windows 10. I was able to cause that to happen in April. So far so good. The result was a 3.5 on a scale of 1 to 5 because a number of my settings were lost (not my contacts or really important stuff), and a rearrangement of how settings were organized, but in general the rearrangement was useful and not a radical departure from 8.1. Most trivial annoyance: default ringtones were changed, and custom ringtones were set to the new default. Best improvements: better response time, better editing and improved options for SIM settings, ADNs.(New-) Around Mid-May, a WIN 10 upgrade rendered my Outlook app unable to complete an action to Reply or Forward. MS' response to-date has been nominal. I've tried both the forums, and a call into Mobile Help. I'm reducing from 4 to 3 stars until this problem is fixed.(More -)The biggest negative to me is the phone's interface to my car's Bluetooth for making phone calls in-transient through the car. The bluetooth uses SIM1. Never SIM2, even with SIM1 off. Microsoft, I hope will one day fix that problem. If it happens, I'd up my rating to 5 stars, even though there are less apps for the Windows OS than Android or Apple.TIP: Hidden extras -- not exactly ""hidden"" but while in the Settings interface, search for ""Extra"" for additional SIM settings. These are not needed for basic or day to day set up, but they help with some Calling details. It also provides a link to the other settings in case you wish to alternate between the two.","0","unhelpful"

"Microsoft Lumia 640 XL LTE Dual Sim Black 8GB (RM-1096) Unlocked international model- no warranty","LG","255.99","4","I picked this up after first owning a Samsung note2, Note3 and then switched to a Nokia 1520 windows phone which a LOVED over the samsungs... The battery life was nothing short of INCREDIBLE.... but I switched after nearly two years to the Nexus 6P which was a flagship... and I found out after only a few months that quick charging isn't as good as NO charging... That Bluetooth doesn't work as well as windows phones in that it doesn't read text messages over BT and allow you to reply verbally... SO, I switched back to my old Nokia until it died a horrible saltwater death after being on a few kayak trips with me... I finally picked up this 640XL as a temporary replacement and I gotta say... This is a fantastic device! The pics are good, the battery lasts all day, it can run the latest WP10.. it's just a great all around device. I'd pick this inexpensive windows phone over a $400 Nexus or Samsung any day of the week... It's just that much better for the price.","0","unhelpful"

I'm not going to go into a full detailed review here, so I'll just focus on the specific details.PROS:-AWESOME battery life-Fair camera-The GPS is pretty accurate-The physical buttons are nice and clicky, even underneath a big rubber caseCONS:-The phone is a little bit underpowered for having an 720HD screen, but it more than suffices for most every application made for Windows 10.-The touchscreen is a little less sensitive than I would've liked-Windows 10 Mobile is still unfinished in many areas; but that is a software thing-The only powerful speaker being on the back is kind of obnoxious","0","unhelpful"
"Microsoft Lumia 640 XL LTE Dual Sim Black 8GB (RM-1096) Unlocked international model- no warranty","LG","255.99","4","The phone arrived quickly which was great because my old Lumia 640 was giving me a lot of problems. I like the Lumia 640 XL a lot but I am missing a lot of things from the regular 640 like Visual Voicemail and certain apps like Indeed and YouTube. I was a little worried with all the postings I saw were phones arrived in a different language, usually Chinese (which mine's did), but as soon as I popped my SIM card in, the phone automatically switched to English with no additional setup required. Overall, it's a great phone for the price but I'll probably get the Lumia 950 XL as soon as my budget allows.","0","unhelpful"

"Motorola XT-910 DROID RAZR Unlocked GSM Smartphone with 8 MP Camera, Android OS, Wi-Fi, and GPS--No Warranty (Black)","Motorola","240","4","What can I say? I only have this for a couple of weeks now and I've already decided that I'll love it. Once I updated the phone to its most recent version, all the problems I had were gone...actually, the only problem that I had is when the phone's camera crashed and can't start up anymore, and the home screen getting out of the viewable area of the screen of my phone. After the update, it's all gone. Everything is working normally, as it should be.There aren't any included Micro SD Card, so I had to buy one for that.No warranty, although I'm not that clumsy anyway.Very light, lighter than the iPhone.Very thin, even with a case; it's still thin. I used a case made by Spigen.It's fast too! It can browse and handle tasks better than my iTouch. I actually had to scream at it, because I never realized how slow it was.I can't create a very good review about the camera though. My previous phone, which was also my first phone, is a Motorola V3i, has a very sucky quality when comparing it at this age. In short, I don't have any other phones to make a comparison, but I thought the video and picture quality is great.Sound is very loud! I mean the built in stereo. It has a future to be my alarm clock, or at least let me hear the person talk loud enough when I'm using the speakerphone during calls. Played a music with it, crystal clear. Made a call, same thing. I never thought the day would come where I don't have to keep saying ""what?""HDMI, USB, and headphone jack is all at the top of the phone...not a very good place in my opinion, but I guess it's the only place they can go.Lastly, the battery life. Without utilizing the Droid Razr's Smart Action feature, I would be charging the phone every night even when I'm not using it. It has always been the problem of the Razr, so I'm pretty used to it dying really fast, but to others, things could get frustrating...especially when you're in the zone.All-in-all, I love it. It has its pros and cons, but I think it's worth the price. UNLOCKED too! That means I can travel with my baby...the problem would be its SIM. It uses a micro SIM instead of the regular SIM.","0","unhelpful"

Also the hinge seems rather flimsy & the phone had the last owner's family photos still in it!! Which could still mean it ""appears to be be new"", but actually wasn't! And if I was the previous owner, I would be horrified if my photos were still in my phone when it was sold to someone else!!! I don't expect it to last very longΓÇöwith the flimsy hinge, but I'm happy to have gotten a similar replacement to my old one. I'm not sure that it is really worth what I paid for it though.","0","unhelpful"

Rather, they provide an unlock code that requires you to place a non-AT&T SIM card into the device. Well, my prepay plan with Net10, is using AT&T Cell towers so it recognized my SIM as AT&T, and so I couldn't unlock it until I got my hands on a T-Mobile SIM from an old phone I dreged up from the basement. You could always borrow a friends' SIM, it really doesn't matter and doesn't hurt their SIM. Even before that, this phone was great.

The tile UI for organizing apps is also very nice.Windows does not have the same level of App coverage as iOS or Android. So, that is a pain. For example, Uber App on the phone barely works.

I cant believe this phone is only $100! how is it possible? I bought one for my mom thinking that she does not need a fancy phone, but I liked it so much I bought one for my dad too :) when my android phone dies, I will switch to windows and probably get one of these phones :) It is a pretty good phone. The screen resolution is not as high as iphone or samsung, BUT 1- it is not bad at all and 2- due to lower screen resolution, the battery lasts 2-3 days instead of 1 day!! I have to charge my nexus 5 at least twice a day!!! It has a decent processor. It has a memory expansion slot. It has basic apps you would need from a smart phone (No you cant play clash of clans, No it does not have 1 kazillion apps like android does), but I dont use a lot of apps either. It is a great deal for someone who wants to have a decent smartphone. I still cant believe it is only $100!","0","unhelpful"

I did, the manufacturers used a cheap glue to glue the screen in. But it gets worse. The design is very bad.

They feel cheap and are cheap, but they are surprisingly durable, have great battery life, and just plain work. I keep one around as a spare phone just in case one of our smartphones die unexpectedly. Also really nice to keep in my suitcase when I travel internationally because I can pick up a local SIM and walk down the street without worrying about someone grabbing my expensive phone.","0","unhelpful"

The only reason i give it a 4 star instead of a star is that it charges using a charger that is not a micro USB, which means if you lose your charger or forget it it may be difficult to find another one as i have not seen this type often ( its a small plug) but other than that functions great and is reliable especially if all you want to do is make calls or text.","0","unhelpful"

"Nokia 3710 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)","Nokia","269.1","5","First - I am shocked at the $30 rise in price in just two weeks for this well-made phone from Nokia. The only thing I can figure is this phone is not manufactured by Nokia anymore, per their web site (it's in their 'archive').That aside, it is a great phone with excellent vocal clarity. The built-in voice recognition is also good. The Nokia's speed dial (unlike the LG LG230 Dimson) is able to assign different phone numbers belonging to the same person (e.g. a speed-dial number for your wife's work and a speed-dial number for you wife's cell). A note regarding 'voice dialing': No need to say ""call"" etc. - just say the person's name. E.g. ""John Smith, Mobile""PROSExcepts up to 8GB microSD RAMSpeed dial number oriented (allows more than one speed-dial number per phone book entry)Works well with Bluetooth: Tested with Bluetooth Headsets┬áJawbone ICON┬áand┬áPlantronics Discovery 975FOIBLESBattery CoverAs with other evaluations, the back of this phone is (putting it mildly) DIFFICULT to remove once the battery is inserted. I suspect the battery forcing the cover up along with the unusual hinge angle over the earphone jack as the cause of the difficulty. I have been successful in carefully prising the cover off the phone: the but-end and then the two sides so they snap loose; then carefully raise the end to unhinge the back from around the earphone jack. Poor design for the sake of elegance. Hopefully, Nokia gets it right on the next flip-phone cover design - WAIT - there is no Nokia flip phone on the American market.15 October 2011 Correction to above comment regarding 'voice dialing': This phone cannot be instructed to pick one of many numbers assigned to a phone book entry - it uses the 'default' number only.","0","unhelpful"

It takes a lot of time to adjust and than to take a picture. Bluetooth connection works very slow as well. It takes minutes to connect to any device - car, ear piece or gps. Buttons need to be pressed very hard to make them work. Light sensor is playing tricks all the time. I don't care about aluminum body and slim design. It does not matter when performance is that bad.

"Nokia 6700 Slide Unlocked Phone--US Version with Full Warranty (Silver)","Nokia","269.1","5","Bought this phone for use in Canada, it works well on Rogers/Fido 3G network (I actually use Speakout service) and should work fine on Bell & Telus too. Standard Symbian phone buttons are well-placed and have a positive feel. Feels slightly awkward when open and texting with one hand, but this is more than made up for by the small size and excellent build quality.Camera is auto-focus but not particularly good, although adequate for a phone of this price. It's generally very fast for a phone camera. When open the camera launch button doubles as the shutter - nice design. Camera works well when scanning 2D and 1D barcodes with the Upcode program. Built-in browser works well. Contact sync with Google Sync works over browsing-only data service (and syncs contact photos as well as contact info) but calendar sync does not (requires software from Nokia that's no longer available). However, the third-party Googasync program works for the calendar.Display is clear and bright. Default settings for ambient light sensor (automatically adjusts the screen brightness) are a little dim, but easy to adjust.Summary: I love this phone. Great for calls and texting, adequate for light web use (checking Facebook, Twitter, mobile news sites).","0","unhelpful"

Phone was delivered in brand-new condition with adapter plug for North American usage. I inserted my SIM card, turned the phone on, charged it, and it works perfectly. The instruction books (2) included instructions in English and in Arabic. I learned I was able to copy all the contacts from my Nokia X3-02 by using Bluetooth, which saved me a lot of time. It took my two tries, but I was successful the second time. I also downloaded the Opera mini browser to use for e-mail. This phone includes the HDSPA 3G frequencies, so it will work for people looking for phones to replace 2G phones as at&t ends that service at the end of 2016. I also gave it a test on T-Mobile. Just fine. Camera is fine for most people and you can upload to your computer using a mini USB to regular USB cord.","0","unhelpful"

"Nokia N81 8 GB Smartphone - Cocoa Brown (Unlocked)","Nokia","269.1","5","Hi, This is my second phone buyed on amazon and for the two I have excellent response in the delivery.My old phone was the N80, and I liked it very much because of all the functions it has, but a little slow when I navigate on internet via wifi, and it has constantly out of memory.Let me tell you that the N81 8GB it's much better, I can browse almost any web page I want, just a problem with sites with flash 8, not supported, but I espect It could be included in a firmware release. Excelent Photos, A lot of memory, I have 2243 songs compressed using about 3.7GB and the quality is very good. The phone has a very good game console (Ngage) so, what else do you want.So the overall of the phone is Excellent phone for a very good price.","0","unhelpful"
"Nokia N81 8 GB Smartphone - Cocoa Brown (Unlocked)","Nokia","269.1","5","I got this phone in April 2008, after using a Palm TX and a IR Nokia phone. I wanted to unify the two items in one single device, but if you read my review, you will find why is that I did not stay with Palm OS.One thing to say also is that I bought it for business although it is not advertised as that, I took the chance and I am very happy with it.Pros:There are many features I would like to review but among my favorites are:- Outstanding battery life even when you connect to the internet via WiFi- 8GB internal HDD- Easy to open keys, lock-unlock button at the top as well.- Screen and Menus completely customizable, so you can decide if you want the calendar in the root menu or in a Agenda folder, for instance.- The center key has 4 quick access ways, so left takes you to Messages, right takes you to Calendar, up takes you to Modes like Silence -meeting etc., down takes you to Clock -international times and alarms.- WiFi is great and fairly easy to set-up.- Bluetooth is great, I can synchronize my calendar and contacts, anniversaries, tasks, meetings, with Microsoft Outlook, and share info with friends, also I use a Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset, which works great with.- Synchronyzing with the usb cable allows you to back up your pictures, music, videos- You can use the phone as an external HDD to carry info, PowerPoint presentations, etc.- You can have your POP3 mail, save as many as you want, decide whether you keep them in the ""phone"" memory or the HardDrive memory.- You can open attachments with the included QuickOffice and also PDF files.- You media manager is great, photos in albums, music playlists and you don't need special software like itunes to manipulate them, (have you tried to retrieve your music from and IPOD to your computer? You can't)Cons- Buttons to music in the front are to tight and hard to manipulate.- It can be tricky to save some access points in WiFi, but you can learn how configure them.- Bad quality camera, not because it has 2megapixels, but because they are 2mp terrible sensor, but not important to me.- It is not as slim as other phones, but non of them with internal 8GB HDD- Gizmo, my wife and I have same phone, we tried to configure the VoIP and it seems that if we are under the same IP- (same house connection) it rejects one of the users, which is awkward since Skype does not give you this issue.- Not compatible with Skype yet (coming soon they say)Overall, the Cons I have had so far are livable with, but the Pros are great and easy to use. It makes my calendar activities easy to keep up with, keeps me in touch via email and I can use it as an external HDD.","0","unhelpful"

"Nokia N9 Unlocked GSM Phone with 64 GB Internal Memory--International Version (Black)","Nokia","228.88","5","I had this for about three weeks. Nearly all of the high-end smartphones today are very large and pushing into tablet territory. Anything smaller usually meant sacrificing build quality or specs. This phone bucks the trend. It's looks clean, minimalist and is unique. (not just another iphone or android)Apps are a non issue for me. this is not a ""fart apps"", or gaming device, but the few apps available are very useful. There is a committed developing community that brings a lot of good features.One minor thing I noticed was the speaker and earpiece volume is a bit low. This is probably a volume limitation to protect hearing. Not a deal breaker, but I will make sure to look for a volume tweak.This is a great phone. Excellent build quality, simple UI and great multitasking. With today's growing smartphone trend, I'm glad I found a pocketable high-end device.","0","unhelpful"

I received it yesterday January 27th from USPS and just after an hour, it indicated that the battery was low. I put it on charge and went out for 6 hours. I came back and the phone was still signalling that the battery is low. I decided to switch it off so that the charging can be effective and after an hour, i tried switching it on and it won't come on. Now i'm stuck with a new phone that cannot be switched on. Just for me to be sure i was not scammed, i checked the product information and the phone is made in Finland, the charger is made in China and the USB cord is made in Thailand. Isn't that fishy? I will take it to a nokia customer center for an evaluation. I hope they give me some good news else i will spread the bad news like a wild fire.I had high hopes for this phone because i have always been a loyal customer of nokia phones but now i'm wondering as to whether i was scammed or that the phone isn't good after all.

In light of the current experience, I can not recommend these phones to anybody, Also, Nokia stopped developing their Maemo line and actually got purchased by Microsoft.

However, after putting in my SIM card and using it for a little I quickly discovered major issues between the phone and my service provider AT&T. Getting MMS messaging to work was a nightmare. I'm pretty sure launching a space shuttle has less input codes. After spending 30 mins on the phone with SONY xperia help line nothing was resolved. I then called AT&T to set up an APN to attempt to get MMS to work properly. Hour later and nothing. Apparently the phone was built for T-Mobile and Sprint as well and for one reason or another AT&T could not properly register the phone to allow to receive MMS. Another issue that I noted immediately and many others have as well is the WIFI. It drops every 10 minutes if that and puts a big ! mark in the corner of the phone every time it happens. Extremely annoying to say the least. Sadly I am returning this phone. At first seemed like a real nice phone but after using it for an hour or so it wasn't able to do what I needed it to do.","0","unhelpful"

The back is make of a matte metallic sheen that is pleasant to the touch and is not slick and will not attract finger prints. Another note is that the back of the phone is completely flat including the camera does not protrude from the body of the phone. Their is a nice chrome lip all the way around the edge front and back that breaks up the black and gray quite tastefully. Lastly the phone is completely symmetrical. The top and bottom are completely identical with the exception of the excellent front camera and photo-sensor and there is a reason for it. I'll explain more in the experience section.HardwareDespite the price this prince is running a Snapdragon 615 octa-core with 4 cores at 1.5ghz and the other 4 at 1.0ghz and 2GB of ram. It has wifi with 5ghz band and 2.4ghz support. I can say that the wifi works well and has great range (helps if you have a good router as well). LTE is band 12 capable for those who will be using T-Mobile. The rear facing camera is a 13 megapixel Sony sensor with a 8 megapixel front facing camera but shoot at 4:3 aspect ratio. If you want 16:9 HD photos the sensor will go bring the pixel count down to 9.4 mega pixel and 5.1 on the front camera. The display is a bright and beautiful 5.5 inch IPS HD display running at 1920x1080P with 401 pixels per inch. And to tight everything together are JBL powered stereo speakers with 2 microphones one on top and bottom of the phone. All that powered by a 2915mah battery.UsabilityI had a Motorola X (2013) which made usability far better than any phone with its gestures and touchless command prompts beyond what OK Google can do. After having that experience its hard for any phone to compete with that. Going from a 4.7 inch display to a 5.5 inch was quite a jump however thanks to the minimal bezels its make it easy to use. I have small hands and reaching across the screen to the left and the top was a little hard put its still possible. The stereo speakers make it a harder because of the extra bezel it creates still nothing compared to the LG G3 or I phone 6 plus for that matter. The phone is very thin and light making completely unnoticeable in my pocket compared to the weight and thickness of my Moto X. Having the big and bright display with stereo speakers made every media experience amazing. The sound was rich and crystal clear, with good highs and mids, low lows but still better than any other phone out there. The photo-sensor works really well with its software. The screen always had the right amount of brightness, never to much indoors in the dark and you can see the display clearly in direct sunlight not problem. The front facing camera is just a dream with selfies (not that I do much) but video chatting and conferencing is just amazing. Google hangouts is a power app and the phone handles it not problem streaming HD and close to 30fps on a good internet connection. The display also runs at 60fps and drops a bit when moving around but its not even noticeable unless you are watching a fps monitoring software.ExperienceThe as a whole runs pretty smooth about 90% of the time. There are delays in opening apps in comparison to the top flagship phones but its only .5 sec behind in opening apps compared to the galaxy S6 or i Phone 6 plus. Once the app is open or in the ram it responds instantly with no lag. The home screen, multi-task bar, and quick setting menu from the top are lag free. Honestly its runs almost as well as any flagship to the point where you question why you are paying $700+ for a phone. The delay is never frustration or interfering with your task but its noticeable compared to the top flagships. I actually found myself preferring my phone speakers over my Bluetooth speakers because of the clarity was far superior. The phone is running a stock 5.0 android experience with an icon pack install with the Acatel launcher. I actually just installed the google now launcher for a more complete stock look. Not a fan of the bright looking icons on the Acatel launcher. The camera is a pretty awesome however the stock camera app is a flop. The image processing is horrible. I installed the google camera app and it did a much better job with the camera and image processing plus it gives you the ability to change aspect ratio and megapixel options. After all this the batter is a big plus. Its a true all day battery with normal usage and even powers users can get a good amount of usage before needing to charge. I was able to get 6.2 Hrs of on screen time watching Netflix through wifi. When power using during the day I got 4-5 hrs of on screen time. Over all if you want a flagship phone without the flagship price brand new, this is it. There is nothing that compares with it.","6","helpful"
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","Alcatel","129","4","Coming from a ZTE Z998, this phone is an enormous upgrade, but does have its quirks. There are many features of the phone that are simply great, but I'll cut the chase and get to the dirt:*Phone is a little laggy at time, especially in Google Chrome.*Double tap to Wake rarely works on time. Sometimes takes up from 1 to 3 minutes for the phone to finally come to the lock screen.*Cellular service signal often just quits. Not sure why, but it is kind of annoying.*LTE signal takes quite a while to lock in. Most of the time the signal comes in with H+. This does effect down/upload speeds.*I've found Bluetooth in my car to be a little quirky. Phone doesn't always sync automatically with my car's Bluetooth. Not sure why?*When getting a phone call with a 3.5 mm jack plugged in and Bluetooth also enabled, call goes through or comes in, but parties on the phone can't hear one another. I've looked into the settings, there may be an issue here?Aside from those issues above, which can likely be worked out if Alcatel ever issues an OTA update, the phone is great. Videos and music are crisp and clear. Games are fun to play, very little lag there. The screen is great! For a phone, the audio is fantastic! You can move your apps over to the SD card to save internal memory. Not all the app data is transferable, but being able to move it over does help. I wish there was a way to control where your ""downloads"" save file to, but unfortunately there is not and a download automatically saves to the phone's memory. You have to make a conscious effort to move the file over to the SD card, as to not consume your internal memory. 11 GB's of memory doesn't go too far these days.For the money at $250, this phone is a pretty good buy and worth the money. It is clear however where Alcatel cut some corners to stay in the $250 price range and still make profit. Too bad phones are so throw away after 2 years of use. Guess that's the nature of technology and people always wanting something better. Enjoy the phone!Screen protector and a phone case are a must if you want to preserve any phone for at least 2 years. There aren't too many phone case options for this phone yet thought. :-(","6","helpful"

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","Alcatel","129","5","I decided to buy this phone on a whim after reading several early reviews. I'm glad I did. No, it's not perfect, but you have to consider what you get for your money. Other reviewers have gone into great detail about pros and cons so I won't repeat here. There are a few quirks, but in my opinion, the pros far outweigh the cons. I thought there was a problem with my external SD card when I couldn't access files on the card. It turned out my card was formatted in exFat. Once I formatted it to Fat32, all was well. When I was setting up my phone I somehow lost 2 screen panels and ended up with only one. I had to factory reset and that cured the problem. Also, sometimes the screen digitizer can be a little balky. The speakers are quite good as are the included earbuds. Maybe not as good as HTC's, but still good. The screen is very good for a phone at this price point. The camera was also a pleasant surprise. No, it won't beat the Galaxy S6 or iphone6, but you won't be disappointed either. I found no lag others have mentioned, but then again, I don't play games or launch multiple apps at once. For what I do, it was as smooth as butter. You will get through a day on the battery unless you are a heavy user. Unless you're a true perfectionist, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this phone when they consider it cost $250 for a no-contract, unlocked phone.","7","helpful"

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","Alcatel","129","2","Update 7/15/15: Alcatel recently released an update for the phone. While it fixed the double tap to wake issue that previously worked inconsistently, it broke Google Voice interception of outbound calls. Therefore, this phone is nearly unusable to me as a phone, since my primary number is a Google Voice number. As a very inconvenient workaround, I now have to load the Google Voice webpage in order to make a call. I am now considering to replace this phone and do not recommend it to anyone who uses Google Voice to make outbound calls. If you already have this phone and use Google Voice, DO NOT INSTALL THE LATEST UPDATE!---------------------------------------Original review:The Idol 3 is an excellent phone for the $200 pre-order price. At the $250 regular price, I recommend weighing the pros and cons against two-year old flagship phones that sell for a similar price. I am looking forward to Alcatel addressing some of the ""cons"" listed below with a firmware update.Pros:- Beautiful, 5.5"" screen- Good battery life- Android Lollipop experience without the unnecessary clutter- Very good speakers for a cell phone- Micro SD card slotCons:- Double tap to wake feature is so unreliable that it may as well not exist- Minimum volume setting for notifications and ringtones is too loud- Screen sometimes does not go to sleep after set time period- Poorer performance in day-to-day use (non-intensive apps, web browsing, e-mail) than 2-year old flagship phones that now sell for the same price, such as an LG G2- Home screen should have the option of fitting 5 columns of icons instead of just 4- Poorer low-light camera performance than an LG G2 (too much noise)- Non-removable battery- High, hard-to-reach power button","7","helpful"

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","Alcatel","129","3","Decent phone, shame it died one day after the one year warranty ended. It was while I was playing kingdom hearts unchained x. Symptoms were: phone got hot, touch screen became unresponsive on and off, the next day blue screen, rebooted, another blue screen, then phone completely died.Dual front facing speakers that get nice and loud so that's a huge plus, mine came with jbl earbuds which is awesome considering how most phones don't even include them anymore. But, the placement of the auxiliary port is located at the top of the phone and this is weird because the mini usb port is located on the bottom. If you used one of those magnetic air vent phone holders for you car, things will get messy as there's no clear orientation to have good cable management when you want to plug the auxiliary cable to your phone while charging. However, the reversible design is nice so that you can make the auxiliary cable be located on the bottom relatively by putting the phone upside down.Coming from a samsung galaxy s3, the idol 3's screen is much more vibrant. Also the phone is about 7mm thin which is just 1mm thicker than the thinnest phone out there. Also you should plan on getting a case for the phone, the back of this phone is really slippery with zero grip which is awful for such a thin phone. So if you get sweaty hands due to the heat emitted from this phone, the chance of it falling is quite high. Another plus was that alcatel did provide a software update to Android Marshmallow, which no one thought they would do considering the idol 4 was coming out, the idol 3 was made by a chinese company which don't really provide software support, and that the idol 3 was a budget phone. The stock os doesn't really come with a lot of bloat, although surprisingly, the clock app that comes with the phone is actually made by avg, the same guys that make the antivirus, which no one would have found out until one day play store decided to update the clock app. The updated clock app was terrible because it went away from the google's material design to some awkward interface. The average rating was around 2 stars before avg reverted back to the original clock app. The biggest con I would have to mention is the very slow flash storage, this is really noticeable when you load files or install apps in the play store.Oh well, time to get a new phone and this is just a lesson to always back up your texts and photos as well as get an extended warranty if you plan on using the phone for a very long time. Especially on devices like these where there is no removable back cover. I set the expected usage to a year anyways when I bought the phone considering it was only 250 when I bought it. The phone did get cheaper, but that's to be expected as time goes on.-----update 9/13/16---------Wow, so they still honored the warranty when my phone died. Fantastic service; they went above and beyond. They shipped the phone back with 2 day ups air too.","8","helpful"

"ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser 5.5"" 2GB RAM 32GB storage, Dual SIM - Factory Unlocked Phone - Glacier Silver","Asus","199","4","ProsVery thin and light, you won't suffer hand fatigue from holding it.Extremely sensitive touch screen (a little too sensitive).Very fast fingerprint sensor.Easy transfer of apps and settings from old device - even all my wi-fi connections and passwords were transferred.Still has the app drawer - You have the ability to organize apps in folders either manually or smartly. It's extremely tedious to do manually when you are organizing many apps, but the smart logic may not be your logic, although it does pretty well. When you first form a folder, it's pretty good at giving it the proper name. It's easy to rename the folder.It has infinite scrolling of screens, so you don't have to backtrack when you hit your last home screen.Has a feature to prevent individual apps from starting automatically and running in the background, which, theoretically, saves you battery life (and less annoyances for background updates)Video resolution is excellent. Handles streaming very well with no lags or jerkiness.I found the audio to be excellent through my earbuds--deep and not tinny. Sound through the speaker, unsurprisingly, not too loud, but still rich.System takes up 8 of the 32 gigs that this phone has, but still plenty of space for me. Has no bloatware (except the usual google crap), and a very nifty laser ruler--which comes in handier than you think.The Gorilla Glass is truly fingerprint and smudge resistant.Battery life is substantial. I had the phone in constant use while setting it up and fooling around for 8 hours, including wi-fi and video and it still had power left before I decided to charge it, so it will get you through your day.Call quality is good - Call blocking is a great featureConsIf there's a way to make the sd card the default write location, I haven't found it. Have to download a 3rd party app to move apps from internal storage to SD card, but right now there's plenty of room on the phone, so I shouldn't have to worry about that for a while.The default screenshot button is to press and hold the recently used app button and it's on by default. Since it's very sensitive, I was always accidentally taking screen shots. If you don't need this feature on a regular basis, I suggest turning it off until you need it.The default email app is Google Mail. If you don't use or want Google Mail, you might want to download another mail app, however, it is easy to add other email accounts to the app.Took some maneuvering to figure out how to set my own wallpaper, but it can be done. Just go to the picture you want, press and then use the settings menu to set it as wallpaper.No earbuds included, but do you really need another pair?No NFC (but that doesn't matter to me)","7","helpful"
"ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser 5.5"" 2GB RAM 32GB storage, Dual SIM - Factory Unlocked Phone - Glacier Silver","Asus","199","5","This is a review for the Asus Zenfone Laser 5.5 2 gig version. After checking reviews and questions answered I decided to try this phone out. In simple terms this is a remarkable phone. It is fast, highly responsive and i haven't noticed a single lag. So I will outline basically the various aspects of the phone briefly.BuildIt feels premium, and looks premium. It is light and very thin and thus I sometimes forget it is in my pocket. I haven't noticed any heating problems. The finger print sensor is easy to set up and is extremely fast and works how they said it would work. I took selfies tapping it flawlessly. Where the size makes it difficult for one handed use the software and the well placed buttons compensate.The screen is beautiful and it makes everything look a little bit nicer.With 2 gigs of ram and 32 gig of storage I have played games I otherwise would not have tried to play on a smart phone. N.O.V.A 3 plays without any lag and so does zombie reaper. So this is a safe device for playing action games keeping in mind the 2 gigs of ram.CameraThis is fast and snappy and the laser autofocus works as it should. I only had a few instances of blurred pics but that was when doing other things and switching back in low light setting. The pictures are beautiful and thought they may not be dslr standards, they are pretty good. The front and back camera take pictures of very good quality.SoftwareSome reviewers on youtube were griping about software but I actually rate the zenUI above samsungs touchwiz because of the amount of control it allows. Yes there are other apps aka bloatware but most have been useful in managing the phone and its systems and is way less intrusive that some similar and popular apps that would be downloaded in the googel store. It comes with built in app lock and a place to hide sensitive files. You can record calls without needing a separate app. In all I have found I hadn't the need to download most of my usual apps. The theme feature is a plus and you can even alter how you scroll though your homepage and how the apps are ordered. It is a Software that allows you to totally make your phone your own.FM RadioIt has a built in FM Radio that works very well.BatteryI would rate the battery as 4 out of 5. It lasts for the entire day with relatively heavy usage but based on what mode you put it in, it could last much longer.Speakers and Call qualityThe speakers are high but since they are mono speakers they obviously won't be as high as phones with dual speakers. The call quality was excellent and I had no trouble with the phone accepting my gsm sim or memory card.In Summary this is an awesome phone thus far and when using it you would think you have a phone that is much more expensive. I believe this is an excellent bang for your buck.","7","helpful"

The screen is sharp and clear even in sunlight. I even light the ZenUI! It has not overheated yet and the fit and finish are superb. This has been said before, but this truly looks like a more expensive phone. The camera with Laser focus is super fast and takes remarkably good pics. Granted, I'm not a photo aficionado not expert, but for the average user I think it will not disappoint. Accessories are still coming out, but you can find a cover easy enough. Just be sure to use the model number when looking as there are multiple models with similar specs.The Con:After updating the firmware to ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser ZC551KL (Z01B) software Image: WW_V11.40.53.17, my phone no longer will make/receive phone calls. Mobile internet/MMS/SMS work just great tho. ASUS was prompt in diagnosing faulty hardware and I am getting a replacement. Could happen with any product, my point is that support was prompt and professional.Update: 14 Nov - Two firmware updates later and the phone hasn't skipped a beat. Asus tech support think that it was a corrupted download that caused the issue previously. The phone has great camera features that I've been playing with. There are modes like HDR Pro, Beautification, Super Resolution, Children, Low Light, Night, Depth of Field, GIF Animation, and Smart Remove among others","7","helpful"

"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Black (U.S. Warranty)","Asus","235.16","1","I bought this phone a month ago. At first I thought I was just using it too much in the beginning (as we all do with new phones), as my battery would drain very fast (had to recharge it at least once a day or even more). Than however I noticed that even if I used it or not the battery life still was very bad. (I had the phone on super savings mode and only used it to check the time a few times and still the phone did not last for longer than 24 h, it should be more than 200 h in standby according to the phone itself). I tried a lot of things I found on the internet but nothing solved the problem.Secondly the phone would just shut off every time it reaches 30%. So once I reached 30% within 5 seconds the phone was 'dead' and not usable for at least 10-15 minutes of charging. I checked on the internet on this problem specifically and read that a lot of people are heaving this problem and the only fix is to get a new battery (which is impossible to bye separately as the battery can't be removed..).Third, I was unable to connect my phone to the computer.. I tried it with the official cable, alternative cables and WiFi (I was able to connect via WiFi but than not able to get any files transferred). What are you with a 64 GB phone if you can't even get anything on it..I think that I may just have been unlucky and got a phone with a very bad battery and bad USB connection, but for me this has been the worst phone I have ever had and thus I returned it and do not even think about having a replacement phone of this brand. They know they have problems with the batteries, but they are still selling them with these bad/broken batteries.","8","helpful"
"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Black (U.S. Warranty)","Asus","235.16","5","This is the best buy on a powerhouse phone that I've ever seen. IMO the build quality is 5/5 star, screen is 5/5 star, size is 5/5 star, camera is 5/5 star and the battery is 5/5 star. And the best part is all of this and a very nice UI for only $299 for the 4gb/64gb, or $199 for the 2gb/16gb phone.I've read almost all the reviews in full, to date about 300 if them, and my opinion on most of the nit pickers is they just want to feel smarter than the rest of us. Or they can't stand the fact that they have this instead of an iPhone, htc or LG etc,This phone is a very fast HD screen large (but not to large) powerful smartphone. Not a flip phone. So it's power hungry and the battery isn't going to last 3 days if your using it as intended. I get a full day now. But when I first got it and was learning about UI and all the settings, watching videos and playing with it all day I kept having to plug it in to charge it. I would think that is normal. Learn how to optimize it and get more time out of the battery. I find that for what this is, under normal use, the battery is great. I can get all day (about 12 to 14 hr). What more do you need?The Zenfone ui does have lots of Asus apps (bloatware) that can uninstalled or killed. But after looking at some of their apps I decided not to uninstall any of them until I've really used them and know for sure that I can't of won't ever want to use them. Any time I get a new Phone, Laptop, or desktop computer I go through this. I happen to like the ZenUI just fine. If You don't like it go to the play store and put your favorite Launcher on it.I hear some folks gripe about the build quality. They don't like plastic. I feel that lots of those folks would run out and get a plastic case for their HTC and complain that it was plastic. Your car dash and molding is plastic isn't it? What about your trash can? Asus didn't hide the fact. I think this phone feels fine in my hand and that's what counts. Also about the curved back, a few of the reviewers bellyached about that! Come On guys, it isn't as though it moves around like a play marble. Put a case on it.Last thing, I've read some complaining about the camera. I haven't seen any issues with the cameras. In fact it takes very very good pictures for what it is. I'm no longer a professional Photographer (was when in the Navy 50 years ago) but if I was I wouldn't use a cell phone camera, it would be some type of SLR. This has a nice camera that most of us will never use to it's full potential. Once you learn all the settings I think you'll see what I mean.Don't listen to the nitpickers! This is a very nice phone and a Best Buy. Get it and give yourself time to learn all about it. You'll be glad you did.Oh and did I say how fast it is? It is very fast.","8","helpful"

"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Gold (U.S. Warranty) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","Asus","225","5","Very pleased with the phone. I received it yesterday and the shipping was fast. I am on Straight Talk AT&T. The SIM reading took longer than I expected Picking up signal. guess this do to being unlock reading all bands trying to lock on. Once I put in the setting for LTE it first came up as H+ I restarted the phone and it now show 4G using band 17.My thoughts on the phone:Performance the phone flies does everything I ask it to do without any lag. Coming from older Android device you get in the habit of closing apps or having task killer and you find yourself doing this when ever you bringing up new apps.With this phone I find myself doing the clear recent task which you do not need to do so. So trying to break the habit and going back to recent apps finding that I have 20 apps open at one time without seeing any lag. Yes the habit of always clearing out task or tapping the ram booster will be broken soon.Many reviews on the ZenUi I can say I like the ZenUI fast snappy. Being up front about it now that Android has been out for years growing launchers are all getting better and better. So they copy each other in looks it is really what you like. I do not see anything wrong with it.The 4GB of ram is a great plus a f handles task very well, once again the phone flies.The camera: not much to say as I'm not a person that has to have a good cell phone camera. I am a DSLR guy and a compact camera such as the Lumix LX-3 they all shoot RAW. So far as this camera it's ok with the default software. I will give it points that you can shoot in manual control your own shuttle speed up to 1/800s and ISO low as 50. Android 5 allows us to shoot in RAW but Asus has not allowed this for the phone yet. The best camera software to have FV-5 they haven't turn on RAW support for this camera yet.I only use cell phone camera as a GPS tag for my DSLR camera or quick selfie or food shots. So until the software catches up with the hardware or the RAW features are turned on then I wouldn't out to much stock in cell phone camerasThe speakers suck they are not as loud and setting it for alarm wake up you may over sleep.Power button: a lot of people reviews complain about this. I have no complaints. With the double tap on and off you will forget about the power button. You'll see Γÿ║ you will be like where's the power button at?Volume button. Will take some getting use to all the phones I've had were on either left or right side.Order 128GB will be here soon for my music collection and movie watchingFor the cons which are a deal breaker for most would be the bloat ware apps. I know and understand y Asus putting these apps on allow them to promote there apps and others to allow the phone to be at a lower price. But Dang please allow us to uninstall what we do not want. Some apps are able to uninstall. Example Kids Mode app. What if some people buy the phone that do not have kids they should have the right to uninstall this app. Even though we have 4G RAMThis app still runs taking up space and resourcesThis RANT to those who are not a TEch savvy person.To get rid of these apps ROOT your phone take off Bloatware you do not want or Freeze them. Freezing them won't give your space back but with 64GB and SD card slot you will not miss that space. It will not run in the background.The Asus Keyboard sucks not a deal breaker always Google keyboard.Those are my cons which is software base that can be changed by ROOTING uninstalling apps that are bloat ware and of no use to me. Very please with the phoneNo problem with the display saw complaints that it wasn't bright enough. Bright enough for me to each there own. I'm into speed and performance and this phone does that. Lag is deal breaker this phone has none. Hope this review helpsFor the money this phone is worth the buy. I was saving up for the Sony Z3 but this ZenFone 2 is awesome and for the price you will be please.Asus makes great quality products as a Transformer Infinity user I am well pleased with the phone.","10","helpful"
"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black","Asus","189.99","5","This phone is amazing, simply put. I came from a previous Sony Android based phone, and a Blackberry Z10. I actually loved the Z10; very durable, good quality, no freezing/hanging. Software was great, but apps were limited. This ASUS phone does everything you could possibly think of, and FAST. Some have suggested removing bloatware; while there are some odd ASUS apps, it is NOTHING like buying a phone from ATT that has 30+ ATT apps on it. The phone is efficient, smooth, and with a beautiful screen, and mine is the 2GB RAM, 16GB memory version. I can't imagine how fast the other one is. The one ""con"", to me, is the size. My previous phones had 4"", and 4.5"" screens, respectively. The 5.5"" screen is big. Not too big to fit in a pocket, but awkward to manage with one hand (like I could with previous phones). Not a big deal. I would highly recommend this phone. It is truly amazing.","11","helpful"
"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Black (U.S. Warranty)","Asus","235.16","1","First and foremost, I feel the need to state that Amazon handled my issue with this phone when ASUS wouldn't. Amazing support and overall experience.Now to the nitty gritty, this phone started off relatively solid. I wasn't expecting the performance or the extras of the big brand flagships due to its price, however I was more than pleased with this phone functionally speaking (When it was WORKING). I've owned the phone for 3 months, and the problems really started rolling in after the first month.First, the phone would periodically restart for no reason, which of late has been an increasingly frequent issue. Second, the phone often time fails to awake after going into lock/sleep mode. It will simply lock up with a black screen, and not respond. Other issues have been relatively minor, and if it wasn't for these more major issues, I wager the phone would be fine (biggest not defective issue is the speaker phone, headset speaker, and microphone are of very poor quality). That being said, with time the severity of all of the issues has steadily increased.Needless to say, I finally emailed ASUS tech support which did not have a solution for my problems, instead I received in broken English a redirect to call customer service. After calling their customer service, I was finally told that I could ship the phone at my own expense to be repaired, which would take several weeks. As with most people, going without my phone for several weeks wasn't an option.I have been a long time supporter of ASUS products, namely computer hardware, the phone did not live up to their quality standards in my experience.In my frustration, I contacted Amazon (even though it was technically no longer their issue), and they in fact lived up to their standards and quickly remedied my issue. Thank you Amazon!If you are in the market for a quality, unlocked phone, check out the Motorola X Pure. Amazon will be one of the primary sellers of the product, and it is on par with other flagship phones.","11","helpful"

"BLU ENERGY X Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery - GSM Unlocked - Gold","BLU","135.99","1","**6 Month and final update in comments.**I have had the phone for about a week now. It seems like a decent enough phone, but I am not sure what everyone is talking about it's quality for like it's a $600 iPhone... it is far from it.The battery and rear cover. Pain in the ass. The cover comes off, and the buttons for volume and to turn the screen on and off are actually on the battery cover. So when you remove the back, you cant do anything. The battery is non user friendly removeable. I had to remove it anyways the first day I had the phone because I went to update it and the screen went blank. The phone died and I had to remove the battery connection like I was taking apart a PC's HDD/SSD. It finally turned back on once I plugged it back in and into my computer. That was the first time I noticed why this phone only cost $100.I attempted to make a phone call using the speaker. I called my bank. The screen kept going in and out and flashing, not letting me press the speakerphone button or the keypad button. It did this the entire time until I was able to hang up the call. It does this every time. It has also muted a call while I was on the phone. I never had these problems with any other phone. Also, the volume is extremely loud! You cannot even turn the voice volume down! this is by far the worst feature I have found yet, I mean it is LOUD! especially on speaker.I am not sure what the other reviews are talking about. This phone feels like a $100 phone, and works like one too. Some positives are already listed in the specs of the phone. you will not find another phone that looks like this or has these componets for such a price, and that is why I pulled the trigger on it. Before this phone, I had a $30 alcaltell one touch that lasted 2 years. It was a piece of junk, but I damn sure never had these problems with it...Some other issues I have had with this phone that I was always able to control or turn off on other smart phones:notifications! this phone is horrible about them! the way they are displayed on the lock screen is completely stupid and a pain in the ass to try and open.Screen backlight: I have mine set to auto, and it is constantly flickering without even moving the phone. It's not bad, but it's way too powerful. I never had this problem with auto brightness before either, so i turned the screen all the way down on this phone. also, I set it to lock in 30 seconds, 2 minutes etc etc... and it still does it in under 10 seconds. every time.I am sure there is more, but I will update as I go. It's only been a week and the phone is still being broke in, but for the specs listed it seems like it should be a lot more responsive and have a lot less of these issues that I listed. Having had this many issues, I would avoid buying another ""Blu"" phone, and would rather shell out another $100 or so for a better brand with more reliable services to customers just in case.","6","helpful"

Adding that source to the phone's blacklist did nothing to help--the ""messages"" came through even FASTER.I plugged my SIM cards into an unlocked Android, set up the APN, and the group message showed right up as it was meant to.IF you can convince your friends to never text you again, maybe this phone would be a good choice if you wash your Android like I did. IF you could disable text messaging on this phone (or through your provider), then maybe this would be a good spare phone.If all you want is a simple, basic, phone that makes and takes calls, then go buy that phone over there instead.","6","helpful"

"BLU VIVO 5 Smartphone -5.5"" 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 32GB +3GB RAM - Gold","BLU","199.99","5","Better then the Nexus 5x (and I own both)...Honest review paid for by me on both phones let me start..LooksVivo 5 wins hands downScreen Nexus 5x ... that's not to say the screen is bad on the Vivo it's really good. Can only tell it's not as good when you hold it side by side with both on.ResponsivenessVivo 5 . That extra gig of ram and the mediatek processor really shine here compared to the snapdragon 808 and 2gb on the nexus.SoundVivo 5 again. Bass isn't quite as good as the 5x but clarity is much better as are the highs and midsCall QualityI am a u.s. person living in europe the gsm bands are close on both phones but the actual PRL's for my area are better on the vivo. Calls made to the U.S. and my wife here in Europe were the same as in no one could tell on either end what phone was what.Battery LifeVivo again. It's not just the battery size though . Everything about this phone on paper is less a battery hog then the 5x. Rooted, with every tweak I can think and turning off gps and anything else i can of I was lucky to get 5 1/2 hours of Screen on time (SOT after this) on the 5x. The Vivo does not have doze yet (it's coming) or the newest version of android and yet I can easily get 6 hours of SOT without babying it at all. Everything on full throttle baby! I love it. (Pro tip on battery life for any phone or tablet ... uninstall Chrome or any Chromium based browser and go Firefox. You will have the same features, and speed and also gain a noticeable bit of extra battery life. That, and uninstalling facebook and just using the browser to access will gain you an extra 40mins of battery life a day or more I promise you )Long story short...If you want to spend less then $400 for a phone that blows away the competition hands down this is better then the LG 5x or the Asus zenfone 2 I have owned all three and gave the 5x to replace the zenfone for the Mrs. while I kept the Blu.","6","helpful"

"BLU Win JR 4-Inch Windows Phone 8.1, 5MP Camera, Unlocked Cell Phones-White","BLU","54.99","5","I purchased this phone to replace my daughters Lumia 520. Windows Phone 8.1 runs extremely well. It is very responsive. The backup from the 520 downloaded and installed quickly (over wifi). Music was transferred with the micro sd. All album art and music quickly synced and was ready to play immediately after setup. The only thing that would remind someone that this is a budget phone would be the screen size 4"". The body is plastic but feels very sturdy and the back was easy to open unlike nokia phones.Now I use the Lumia 1520 (The Windows Flagship Phone) and it would be unfair to compare the hardware with this phone. But I can honestly say the OS felt just as responsive on the Win Jr as mine. Also if you have not used Windows Phone before this would be a good phone to give it a try. The OS is elegant and feels like it was built from the ground up to give the user the easiest and most enjoyable experience possible. I previously used an iphone 5s and I must say after using Win Phone 8.1 Id never consider returning to ios. The only drawback is that Windows has about 80-90% of the most popular apps in its store so you may want to check the store to ensure your favorite app is available.","8","helpful"

"VIVO IV Full HD Super Amoled,13MP,(16GB+2GBRAM)-Factory Unlocked (White Silver)","BLU","209.99","2","This phone was bought for my 18 yr old son. I returned the VIVO IV a few days after receiving it. Everything about the phone was great except the battery life. We tested the battery life in comparison to the Moto G and Nexus 4. I fully charged all 3 phones layed them down and walked away for 10-15 minutes. When I came back to check the battery levels the Moto G was at 95%, Nexus 4 at 94% and the VIVO IV at 79%. It's a shame, if not for the battery life the phone would have been a keeper. The Nexus 4 has a poor battery life as well but this phone is worse. For an additional $40 since there was tax added for this phone my son purchased the Moto X 16 gb from the Motorola website and customized the phone for no additional cost. His name will come up in the boot load and is displayed on the back of the phone. He picked the phones color and screen background as well as other benefits.

"BLU Dash 3.5 II D352L Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM 4G HSPA+ Android Smartphone - White","BLU","109.99","2","I bought this phone to travel with - the D352L is the Global GSM model, with the proper bands for HSPA+ for outside of the United States. (HSPA+ will work with certain carriers in the United States, too, depending on your location. I was able to get high speeds on T-Mobile in Kansas.)In the box you get the phone, a battery, a charger, a micro USB cable, a pair of earbuds, a screen protector, and the manual. The charger outputs 5V at 600mA, which is less than half of most phone chargers. However, this is fully sufficient, because even on a higher powered charger, this phone only draws about 500mA to charge. (This means you could also charge the phone off of a computer's USB port - or, really, any USB port.) Battery life is passable, I got through more than a full day on a charge.The phone is lightweight but does not feel too much like a toy. Call voice quality is passable, especially for a phone at this price - it is on par with GSM calls on my Nexus 6. The display is passable if you are looking at it directly, but off-axis viewing suffers greatly. It also bears mentioning that the touchscreen is single-touch only - no pinch-to-zoom is available, for example. I can't be sure, but it feels like the calibration is off, too - I don't often hit the keyboard keys I mean to hit. (This may just be a function of the small screen and my big fingers, though.) Dual-SIM operation on this phone is relatively painless. A wizard walks you through what SIM you want to use for data, calls, etc., and lets you label the cards. Slot one is a full-size SIM slot, while slot two accommodates a Micro SIM.I had high hopes for this phone, but unfortunately the amount of internal memory accessible for installation of apps severely limits the utility of the device. I installed a 16GB MicroSD card and started by pulling up the Play Store and installing Hangouts and Gmail. I then tried to install Google Maps, but was told by the phone that I was out of storage. It turns out that Hangouts has to install on the internal memory (as opposed to the SD card), and even the other apps have a portion of the data on the internal storage. I reset the phone and took a more methodical approach to installation, installing the smallest apps first and working up to Hangouts. I was able to get Gmail, Maps, Facebook Lite, and Hangouts installed before it prevented me from installing YouTube or anything else.I did attempt to root this phone to see if I could mount a partition of the SD card so the phone saw it as internal storage, but all attempts to root the phone through known exploits failed.I could only recommend this phone for users that may only install one or two apps and do not need to use the phone for texting or typing very often.","10","helpful"
"BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White","BLU","429.99","5","Bought this to use in conjunction with my Oneplus 2. Thought I would just use it during the times when I didn't want to carry around a bigger phone, and it turns out that it is the only phone I use. Exceeds expectations in almost every category. Would buy again and highly recommend it to others. People are amazed at how thin, light, and fast it is. The screen is amazing and so is the battery life. The camera is decent, but obviously not on par with the Oneplus 2 unfortunately. If you are looking for a great phone for a great price, look no further. I use it on T-Mobile and get 4gLTE speeds consistently. The on screen keys are okay, but if there was one thing I wish it had it would be capacitive keys. Cannot stress enough how amazing this phone is. Thin, light, fast and well engineered. You could buy five of these for the price of one IPhone 6s too. And it comes with a case, screen protector, and headphones in addition to the wall charger and USB cable. Blows my mind!

"BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White","BLU","429.99","2","I really wanted to love this phone. My husband has the first Vivo Air and raves about it. I was super excited when the LTE came out and couldn't wait to show him up.Unfortunately, that never happened. After I had it setup and all my favorite apps downloaded I started noticing the lagging. First, when playing my usual games, and the games the hubby plays on his phone, it started freezing. I deleted all the unnecessary apps thinking it was a space issue. No better. I dealt with the lag/freezing the first two days then on day three I woke up, after having it plugged in all night, to 16% battery. I checked the plugs, everything was good. I unplugged and plugged it in again a few times before it started charging. That happened a few more times over the next few days but again, I really wanted to keep the phone. The last straw was the call quality. I could hear the caller but they could barely hear me. Usually after a minute or so the call was lost and they'd call back so I could continue yelling my side of the conversation.The screen is beautiful and the phone felt as if it was meant to be in my hand. I've come to the conclusion that I just got a defective one. Everyone else seems to love their new Vivo Air LTE and I haven't been able to find people experiencing the same issues. So, I'm returning it and hoping to find true love in one of the other models BLU offers.","10","helpful"

"Star 4.5 US GSM (Yellow)","BLU","89.59","4","Had it for a couple of weeks now. Looks like stock Android, which is great. Comes with everything you need, including a bumper case and screen protector, which is above and beyond. Everything seems to load up pretty quickly, including websites. Battery seems to last a couple of days at least if it's not being used, which is great.Pros:+ Price! Half the price of most unlocked phones.+ Android 4.4 Kit Kat, and BLU says they'll be doing upgrades to Lollipop in June, so basically the latest version of Android.+ Removable Battery! Thank GOD! It's nice to be able to replace the battery yourself and give the phone to your kids. Or just buy a bigger one without depending on someone to open the phone up. This is the way it should be. Phones don't need to be thinner than this anyways.+ Bumper case, screen protector and even pretty comfortable earbuds with remote and mic are included.Cons:- Unfortunately, every emergency number is programmed in, including 123, which is my provider's voicemail number. I found a way around it, but it's a little annoying.- Can't find any alternative cases to purchase for it, but the included bumper case seems to be more than sufficient, so no biggie.- Hardware buttons not back-lit. A little harder to use in the dark. Can be remedied with software apps, however.- ""Video-Call"" camera seemed a little weak, but this will be used very little anyways. The normal camera, however, took some great photos.- Voice on speakerphone didn't sound so great. But again, probably won't be used that much at all. Using the phone normally sounds fine.To me, this is probably as complete as a budget smartphone as you can get. This might make me jump off of the iOS bandwagon completely.","10","helpful"

Typing is smooth and Cortana is a really handy feature especially when on the go. Taking photos is a snap but the quality of the camera is just mid-range. At random times the phone freezes when I press the home icon and I have to lock then unlock the phone. Happens very rarely but would be nice if it were fixed. Speaker is mid-range but I mostly use Bluetooth in my car or headphones anyways. I like how it looks and feels as well.

Also had problem holding the signal with ATT on either sim slot. Had signal and then suddenly no service, lasted 1 or 2 seconds, then service would return. No lte support either.The screen os bright but if you are looking at it from the top of the phone, it washes out quick. Compared to my old Samsung focus flash, this is the same size, very similar design, although the back wraps all four sides and I wondered when I would break the back since I removed it a lot to fiddle with the sim card. Two full size sim slots plus sd slot in the back. This could be a winner, but the restarting randomly and the low storage (4GB; around 2.1GB free when you get it) ultimately has put me off this one. I wanted to like. Oh I also tried calling tech support, but after 30 minutes of hold music, I gave up. Email wasn't acknowledged, yet, either.UPDATEI returned the first phone due to the restarts/dropping service issue. I got the replacement phone today and it seems to be doing ok so far. I mentioned the low storage you can add an SD card, and I have to say that if you are going to do much with any apps, you will need one. I have ordered an SD card.. While it is a budget phone, I still think they should start it with 8GB since the OS takes half of the 4GB. What's that add $5 to the phone? The first phone also had some sensitivity issues with the display that have not showed up on the new one. I'm going to give this one a bit more time and see if we can keep the revised 4 stars.UPDATE 2Using the phone daily so far have only had a few issues. A couple of times I have had no service (voice or data) even though the phone shows service. (and in places there should be plenty of signal). And there are app crashes that my wife has no trouble with (she has Lumia1020). Even IE has crashed a few times. Even so, I'm going to keep using for now..","12","helpful"
"Life One X Quad Band Unlocked - 16GB (White)","BLU","330","5","I bought this phone after weeks of researching and comparing brands VS price VS features.

"BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone - 5.5-Inch Display 4G LTE GSM Unlocked, GREY","BLU","199.95","3","Very nice phone for the money but maybe it is not ready for the market yet.The phone works fine with good specifications. Camera takes good pictures with a lots of features but not as good as my Samsung note 4 edge. However the front led flash is really a plus.The screen is very clear and bright but I found my wife's vivo xl's screen is better when compared side by side even it is an older model. Everything else works fine. It would be 5 stars if the following problems did not happen.1,I accidentally got into the Guest mode somehow and stuck with it and could not get out, I called blu service for help, after 45mins the first tech told me to reset the phone and said the phone is too new and there is no option built to select the users in the setting.then I was transferred to the next level of help, after half an hour, no solution and told me they will get back to me. I don't think I should reset the phone every time if my phone is in the Guest mode. If they have not thought about this simple thing ,they should not let the phone hit the market.2, I have not getting any solution at this point from blu. i lose access to my pictures and phone call log and other things still.I like the phone but can't really use it if I can't get out from the Guest mode.","14","helpful"
"BLU Dash C Music-Global GSM - Unlocked Cell Phone (Yellow)","BLU","59.99","5","For the price, this is a great phone. Just know what you are getting into. With only 512MB of RAM and a 1GHz Dual core CPU, you can't expect it to be blazing fast. I bought this phone after I broke my LG G2 because I needed something to hold me over until I got a more powerful (and expensive) phone. I used it for about a month.That said, it is really adequate for getting basic smart phone tasks done. It has a very no-frills version of Android, which is exactly what you want in an under powered phone. I feared that BLU would attempt to recoup some of the phone's cost by adding in a bunch of bloatware, but thankfully, they didn't. This phone starts with the basic Gapps and default Android ASOP apps and an FM tuner and that is it. It is great and a refreshing change from the Samsungs, LG and HTCs of the world who seem determined to slow down their phones with apps their users don't want.You can't run too many apps at one time in the background, this is simply a one-app at a time phone. I didn't load it up and expect Facebook messenger, Gchats, Skype, Whatsapp, and my web browser to run all at the same time. Instead, it is best to use one of those chat apps at a time, and use the phone to check emails and browse the web. Likewise, don't expect to run graphic intensive games on this, but simple 2D games should be doable (I played a lot of Cook, Serve, Delicious and had no issues)Where this phone really shines is its speakers. They are way better than any $60 phone has a right being. I'm not a huge audiophile, but it was louder than my old Galaxy Nexus, louder than I remember my G2 being, right below my girlfriend's iPhone 6 and about equal with my new OnePlus One. It also doesn't have a that ""tinny"" sound older cell phone speakers are known for. Don't expect it to replace your bluetooth speaker, but it will do an adequate job playing music and like I said, way better than a budget phone user could expect.Screenwise, not the greatest but it gets the job done. I watch most of my videos on my Chromecast and it had no issue pushing videos to that. The battery is small so watching videos would probably drain the battery quickly, but it had no problems running quick videos on ESPN.com or through the normal video streaming apps (YouTube, Netflix etc.) the few times I did do it.Pros: Great price, has the right features where it counts, dual-speakers, FM tuner (a rarity in the US) expandable storage and just enough power to get by.Cons: ""just enough"" power might not be acceptable for some people, battery is small, screen resolution is low. Lack of support from accessory makers and custom ROM developers (if you are into that sort of thing) on phone storage is prohibitively lacking.Overall: A great phone for the price. Don't expect it to do everything the big boys do, and don't expect it to do it as fast, but it is a great backup phone or (with its dual SIM and two versions) an amazing travel phone. I don't have kids but I'd imagine this would make a good starter smartphone for a kid as well. BLU did an amazing job of skimping on the right aspects while going all out on the things someone might want.If you want a ""budget"" phone but good speakers are important to you, then this is the phone for you.","15","helpful"
"BLU WIN JR - 4.0"" Windows Smartphone - Global GSM Unlocked - Yellow","BLU","59.99","5","This phone is a perfect product for those looking for a cheaper alternative to a windows phone. This phone is responsive in more ways than one, the features are pretty great, except that the internal storage is a bit small, coming in around 4GB's, so a External SD card is recommended(8+ GB's if you like apps).The Store has a very limited selection of apps, which is unlike the Google Play Store, and the Apple Store. But I'd like to see something with a better choice in games and apps in the near future.This was a perfect upgrade from my Galaxy Discover(which was extremely disappointing performance out of the box.Cortana is by far my most favorite feature as I can have fun all day long asking stupid questions and getting answers.Now onto the accessories. It comes with a pair of headphones, USB wall charger, Silicone Case(Which did not come in my unit, and was kind of disappointing, and also states that it comes with one on the product box) and a standard USB to Micro USB charging cable.Unfortunately, it would be best to use the included charging cable as most other charging cables that I have used, have been loose when plugged into the phone and could be easily unplugged if you weren't careful.When using this device, it does tend to get warm from time to time when playing games, or having excessive use which is commonplace when it comes to electronics at this end of the market, but all devices get warm from time to time.I'd recommend this phone to anyone who enjoys something a bit different than the typical android or IOS device.Overall, this product is right for me, and for those people who are looking for a cheaper alternative than those that cost upward to around $150+, then this product is perfect.","15","helpful"

"BLU DASH X2 - 5.0"" Smartphone - US GSM Unlocked -Gold","BLU","74.99","5","Just as described! Phone feels very sturdy and has a very high end finish. Some people that have reviewed stated the the phone was made out of plastic which is not so, the back cover is made out of aluminum and has a plastic frame. For me it was not difficult to open the back cover to be able to place the battery and SIM card, the phone has a small slot next to the charging jack that allows you to pull to open the back cover. The phone came with everything needed and was very surprised with the screen protector that has the borders in the same color as the phone (rose gold). About the battery life mine has lasted for a whole day without charging with moderate use ( only calls and texting). I would suggest to get extra memory with an SD card since it only has 4 GB left to use for apps and media, I have downloaded Facebook and whatsapp and that is more than enough for me.

"BLU T176T Jenny TV 2.8 Unlocked Quad-Band Dual SIM Phone (Black/Blue)","BLU","74.47","5","My ""smart"" phone was damaged recently so I took it as a sign and an opportunity to free myself from its clutches. I have embraced the freedom of just having a basic phone. I don't need to check the weather every morning--I can look out the window like my ancestors did. I don't need to look at photos that are limited to only 3 inches. I don't need apps that more than waste my time. I don't need a music player which diverts me from engaging in conversations with real people. This phone from Blu--a Florida-based company is very functional. Call quality if fine--great volume, although just slightly muffled. There is jack for head phones, contrary to some reviews. the FM radio has very good reception and is easy to operate if you so inclined. There are many settings for the camera, including white balance! Texting is the old-fashioned way and its works great (texting is something I appreciate). The phone powers up from a shut down in just 8 seconds, and is ready to use. There are three ring tone to choose from and three message alerts as well. The menus are intuitive and a little more complicated than you would expect. The larger screen size is very nice and the graphics are bright, even if not the most crisp like you would see on a smart phone.I ride public transportation to work. Often, every direction I look there is a sea of humanity transfixed, seemingly by their gadgets. Many with earphones on and many playing games. One writer coined the term that we are ""amusing ourselves to death."" I now think less about checking my emails (can do at home or at work computer) and getting sports scores and more about life and what's happening next to me and what I need to think about in order to grow as a human being. A cell hone is a nice convenience. This phone does the basics very well for such a low cost. And, another benefit, I was able to lower my data plan with AT&T and saved over 70 dollars a month! Saving money, liberation from time-sucking devise, simplicity and better awareness of surrounding life--free at last!","20","helpful"
"BLU Win HD W510L 8GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8.1 Quad-Core HSPA+ Phone","BLU","104.99","4","There are so many things that I liked about this product, that it is an easy spend for me. Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros:* Screen resolution is fantastic. I really wanted my phone to be 1920x1080, but even if this phone is not, the ppi is high enough to give a crispy look.* Bought myself a 32gb Micro SD card, I have been able to load most of my apps and songs without any problems.* The device has dual SIM card, which is quite useful as I travel quite a bit internationally, and don't have to sit at airports and change SIM cards.* Speaker on this phone is quite good! To a point where I listen to music just like that! (without even headphones)* Battery life is superb! Fully charged phone with about 40 - 50 minutes of call and the data line ""ON"" all the time, lasts for about 2-1/2 to 3 days. [Yes, I prefer to use Cell phone only for the purposes of quick communication and not as a long time use device for phone calls. That is what land lines are for :-) ]* Windows 8.1 Phone works very well on this device.* Comes with the Gel Cover, which really protects the device and fits snuggly. No need to spend another $10-$15 on that.* Looks very nice too, thin and weighs very less! People do take attention to the phone!Cons:* The processor is a low-end processor which does affect the performance when dealing with laborious tasks. (for example, when using OWA, if there are 200+ mails on the inbox unread, zooming in or zooming out takes a few seconds of delay (whereas, I don't see that issue in my Nokia 920). Similar problem when using ""swipe"" keyboard.* Doesn't support LTE, which reduces its use for me when I am in US (AT&T Network)* I am not sure how the device software update is going to work, will have to wait and see -- since it is not carrier attached.Overall, great worth, and would whole heartedly recommend to any one!","20","helpful"

YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!!!! i had searched and searched for days comparing literally hundreds of phones as well as watching You Tube videos and reading every review on Amazon and eBay trying my best to find a suitable phone. I don't need a phone with a bunch of bells and whistles or one that will let you reach people over in Africa. I just need a phone that will hold my precious grandchildren's beautiful pictures or my 2 cats and 1 dog. I love taking pictures as well as everybody else's and I just need space to put them on! This phone I bought is one I had never heard of and to say I was nervous about buying a phone I had never heard of before is an understatement to say the least! After reading a few bad reviews, I decided to bite the bullet and get it. This is now Saturday afternoon and I have been playing with it and tweaking it to my satisfaction since Thursday. The con's are as follows: You will have to download a launcher. I downloaded Nova and added the Boss icons. I put my sun's card in and it instantly began to work! My phone began to ring the minute I put that simple card≡ƒÆ│ in! I was shocked to day the least! As of right now, the are only a couple of small things that were different and unlike my Samsung sgh. I love that there is so much memory and the screen is so big and bright! The best picture taking phone ever!!!! The speakers are at the bottom and they are better than my other phone. This phone by the way was in sale from regularly $349 to $229 for a 16 GB phone! I'm still playing with this one but as of right now, I love it!Oh.... One more thing. The Company sends a plastic back case for it and a screen protector but you will not be able to find cases for this phone as easy as you have for your others!

"BLU Life Pure XL Full HD, 16MP, 2.2GHz Quad Core Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Blue","BLU","307","4","I ordered this on Monday and received it, as well as the case, I ordered for it on Thursday. YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!!!! i had searched and searched for days comparing literally hundreds of phones as well as watching You Tube videos and reading every review on Amazon and eBay trying my best to find a suitable phone. I don't need a phone with a bunch of bells and whistles or one that will let you reach people over in Africa. I just need a phone that will hold my precious grandchildren's beautiful pictures or my 2 cats and 1 dog. I love taking pictures as well as everybody else's and I just need space to put them on! This phone I bought is one I had never heard of and to say I was nervous about buying a phone I had never heard of before is an understatement to say the least! After reading a few bad reviews, I decided to bite the bullet and get it. This is now Saturday afternoon and I have been playing with it and tweaking it to my satisfaction since Thursday. The con's are as follows: You will have to download a launcher. I downloaded Nova and added the Boss icons. I put my sun's card in and it instantly began to work! My phone began to ring the minute I put that simple card≡ƒÆ│ in! I was shocked to day the least! As of right now, the are only a couple of small things that were different and unlike my Samsung sgh. I love that there is so much memory and the screen is so big and bright! The best picture taking phone ever!!!! The speakers are at the bottom and they are better than my other phone. This phone by the way was in sale from regularly $349 to $229 for a 16 GB phone! I'm still playing with this one but as of right now, I love it!Oh.... One more thing. The Company sends a plastic back case for it and a screen protector but you will not be able to find cases for this phone as easy as you have for your others!

"BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone - 5.5-Inch Display 4G LTE GSM Unlocked, GOLD","BLU","197.92","5","This phone is incredible. I don't mean ""incredible for the price"", which then implies that if you spend more money you'll automatically get a better device. I mean incredible, full stop. I have only purchased ""high-end"" devices in the past, I've tried iPhones, expensive androids, and even a Windows phone that was quickly replaced (there's just no app support on Windows). I currently own a Sony Xperia Z5 that I paid nearly $600 for. This $200 phone performs better than that so called ""high end"" device. Money does not matter anymore, it's getting cheaper to make full-featured phones. Specs matter, the hardware matters, and the value that you're getting matters. Anyway, here's my review:The battery life on this device is impressive. It's not an exaggeration to say that you can get a few days of heavy use between charges. The display is large, pin sharp, bright, and beautiful. Colors are rendered very well on this device.I have absolutely no complaints about the camera and, in fact, I think it has a few features that should be standard on more devices. The sensor is actually a Sony sensor which may explain why I love the camera so much, I'm a longtime fan of the Xperia line. There is a professional mode that allows you to manually focus your shots in addition to controlling the shutter speed, iso, and white balance. That's pretty cool and there are not a lot of phones that will allow that. The slow motion video is a little choppy but usable, it's no worse than the slow motion on my aforementioned Sony phone. The time-lapse video feature is crazy useful, the time-lapse camera has always been my favorite Xperia app so I was excited to see it on this device. There are a few more gimmicky camera modes like mood shot (a polaroid maker with quick filters) and gif mode that are fun to play around with. The low light performance in auto mode isn't anything to write home about BUT the night shot mode does a great job so if you're in low light just switch to that and you'll be good to go. I added a photo of pumpkins that I took in night mode, the only light sources were the tea-light candles inside the pumpkins. There's one more camera mode that I loved, mega-pixel or perfect-pixel or something, that takes a photograph 300 times the size of a regular shot. This is useful for zooming in, you can crop into the larger image instead and retain the image quality.This phone has both a rear and front-facing flash, yet another feature my $600 phone does not have. The rear-facing speaker is my biggest sticking point with this phone, it detracts from the clean design of the back of the phone and of course makes listening to audio without headphones or an external speaker more challenging, but I don't care very much about the built in speakers on my phones so it's not a major concern. The fingerprint scanner is great. I love the placement and I love that it's just a scanner and not a button. The phone looks expensive and feels nice in the hand. It's very lightweight.I would definitely recommend purchasing this device, I don't regret the money I spent on phones in the past because cheap phones used to be...well..cheap, but moving forward I will be buying more phones from Blu.","43","helpful"

"BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White","BLU","429.99","4","Update nearly a month in: I've added to the Cons section. Overall, I'm actually *more* satisfied now then when I first got it. I was initially worried that it would be way too slow for everyday use. I'm happy to report that that's not the case. I'm a ""power user"", and while it's not suitable for intensive graphics, in actual everyday use this holds very favorably compared to a Galaxy S6 (in spite of the Galaxy S6 absolutely *crushing* this phone in terms of specs and raw benchmark numbers). Although this phone has a relatively low-capacity battery, it lasts *significantly* longer than any other smartphone I've owned to date (see below for list), and roughly 150% - 200% longer between charges than the Galaxy S6 in actual real-world use. (Probably because the specs are lower than ""flagship"" models, in terms of CPU power and display resolution.)Overall in terms of style, quality, price, battery life, and performance - I'd say it's an amazing balance. Do take note my updated concerns about KingRoot below though (which has nothing to do with the product itself but is relevant if you want to root it).CONTENTS:- Summary- Pros- Cons- Non-issues (things others complain about that are not real problems)- Benchmark numbers and comparisons- Do first after buying- How to root- WarningsSUMMARY:Thin, incredibly high-quality-feeling, and the display is absolutely stunning (low-res be damned). You will be making tradeoffs though, mainly in performance. Check the ""Cons"" section for specifics. Also be prepared for random strangers to pester you about it, it's so damned thin. (That seems like a pro. But it wears off real quick.)PROS:- This thing is THIN.- Incredibly high apparent build quality. This thing makes my Nexus 5 feel like a kid's toy (But the Nexus 5 does smoke it in performance.) Blows pretty much any Android away in terms of subjective external quality and aesthetics.- Literally out-iPhones the iPhone 6s, in elegance and apparent quality.- $140!- Light weight (also listed as a con).- The display is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous. It's SO vivid, it's actually not as accurate as, say, an iPhone's LCD. But photos and videos do not look artificial. (I'm a hobbyist photographer.) More accurate than just about any PC monitor.- Comes with a perfect case. It's thin, compliments the phone, fits perfectly, doesn't cover the buttons, and doesn't hinder screen gestures on the sides - while still protecting the edges and corners well.- Battery life is amazing. Better than any phone I've owned.- Basically the same hardware and performance specs as the 3rd-gen (2015) Moto G. Which is nothing to write home about, but at almost half the price. And twice the quality experience.- The teensy-tiny speaker is really loud. Not great quality of course, but surprising for such a small phone.- All screens surfaces are apparently not created equal. This is by far the slippery-est touch surface I've ever used. Feels amazing.CONS:- Not very fast. Benchmarks right up there with 4 year-old phones. My Nexus 5 - three years old now - blows this thing away in subjective apps experience. (And objective benchmarks.) But the tradeoffs are well worth it so far, for me. (Especially the battery life!)- The case, while absolutely perfect, is brittle. Dropping it has already chipped off pieces. (Though, better a sacrificial case than no case!) So far, still functional.- If you absolutely need high performance at a low price, don't buy this - buy an older used ""flagship"" phone, like a Nexus 5, Moto X, etc. Can get from reputable dealers on eBay for cheap.- It is so thin, it feels like it's going to crumple or shatter at any moment. In spite of being so solid. Just doesn't seem physically possible for something so thin to hold up. (But has so far.)- Extremely slippery when not in a case. Feels like it's going to spontaneously fly out of your hand.- Slightly too-large non-screen area top and bottom.- Unlocking the bootloader: There is no documented way, anywhere on the itnernet as of this date, on how to unlock the bootloader (in order to install a custom recovery environment such as TWRP or CWM). It can be rooted, but only via a known kernel exploit.- The only known tool to root - ""KingRoot"" - is *incredibly* invasive and probably spyware. (But I think can be kept in check with some effort, documented below.) It cannot be replaced with a more trusted superuser app (like SuperSU), in spite of some blogs saying so (but instructions are for KitKat).- If you really want Marshmallow on this phone, you may be out of luck. For a long time, possibly forever. BLU has been notirously wrong about delivering updates. And without a bootloader lock and recovery environment, you won't be able to install Cyanogenmod 13. (Not that there is any build for this phone of any CM version anyway.) That said: I have Marshmallow on another phone, and use many of it's new features - but it's really not a big deal. It looks and feels the same. (I think BLU has skinned this phone to look just like Marshmallow. Not counting their stock launcher, which I don't use and don't remember.)NON-ISSUES:- LOW RESOLUTION: The display resolution is ""only"" 720x1280. Most modern phones are full HD (1920x1080) or even UHD (aka ""4k""). But guess what: even with +3.5 magnification reading glasses and eyeballs 3"" from the screen, I can't make out a single pixel. Text is buttery smooth, no visible aliasing at all. More pixels = more battery drain, and more graphic horsepower needed to drive. I was worried about the resolution, but trust me - this is actually a good tradeoff, given the already weak CPU and graphics.- IPHONE-LIKE UI: Don't listen to the complaints about the custom launcher UI. Who cares? Just replace it with Nova Launcher - which takes all of two minutes via the Play Store - and be done with it. They haven't messed with stock settings or other apps, so you'll have a pretty stock-like experience in no time.- BLOATWARE: Yes there is some stuff that comes pre-installed. But unlike Samsung et al, most of it can actually be uninstalled. And what can't be uninstalled, can be disabled (effectively removed except for still taking up a little space).- LTE: Some users have said this phone doesn't support enough LTE bands for full LTE coverage. This may be true, but I've yet to notice any LTE coverage or speed problems compared to my Nexus 5. Could just be I live in an area with better than average LTE support? At any rate, with cellular data caps, I really don't need to download crap at 50+ mbps, so it's not an issue for me even if it was true.BENCHMARK NUMBERS AND COMPARISONS:AnTuTu v6.0.1 (listed best to worst):- 2015 Samsung Galaxy S6: 82,087- 2015 BLU Life One X: 37,977- 2013 LG Nexus 5: 32,822- 2015 BLU Vivo Air LTE: 26,875- 2012 Samsung Galaxy S III: 20,355- 2011 Apple iPhone 4s iOS 9.2.1: 13,607Geek bench v3 multi-core- 2015 Apple iPhone 6s: 4,331- 2015 Samsung Galaxy S6: 4,315- 2015 LG Nexus 5x: 2,796- 2015 BLU Life One X: 2,778- 2013 LG Nexus 5: 2,198- 2015 Motorola Moto G (3nd Gen 2015): 1,577- 2015 BLU Vivo Air LTE: 1,403- 2012 Samsung Galaxy S III: 930- 2011 Apple iPhone 4s iOS 9.2.1: 411DO FIRST AFTER BUYING:- Don't bother with a ""screen protector"". This saddens me to see people unnecessarily denying themselves the joy of using a smartphone without protection. Moder smartphone glass is essentially impervious to scratches that pockets, purses, or dropping can dish out. I always keep my phones in pockets with keys, coins, etc. Never had a single scratch in 10 years on any phone. Seriously. Enjoy your phone the way it was meant to be! Be free! This phone's screen is the slipperiest I've ever tried, so enjoy it. Besides, if something is hard enough to scratch this Gorilla Glass, it will go through a screen protector like a hot knife through butter.- Install Nova Launcher to replace the stock ""iPhone-ish"" launcher UI, to get more native Android.- Install the Google keyboard, and uninstall the preinstalled keyboard. It's not actually bad, but I prefer the Google one. (Or actually Swiftkey.) And I trust Google with my prediction data a little better than an unknown entity.- Disable all apps that you don't regularly use, so they don't run in the background. For example, the Facebook app comes with dozens of services and event listeners, so is constantly waking up and consuming resources. If you only use it every other day, disable it when not in use. Trust me, you need every slice of CPU you can get from this phone. (Can be done in Settings -> APps, but if you're rooted, is easier to manage with Titanium Backup.)- Uninstall the Amazon app that comes preinstalled, pronto. It is one of the heaviest apps to ever land on Android. It has dozens of services and event listeners, which means it's constantly wakelocking the CPU, preventing deeper sleep, and hogging CPU and RAM. There's nothing you can do to prevent that; no task killer or app hibernator will fix it. You're better off with Amazon through a web browser, but if you need an Amazon app, install the lighter-weight version from the Play Store. It does most of the same things, but without it's own app store.- Root the phone (see section below). You'll need to in order to properly run ""Greenify"" (which will run without root but much less usefully).- If you are rooted, install Greenify, which helps tame the runaway processes. You can install and use Greenify without root, but the non-root mode is essentially pointless and annoying. Since this phone isn't the fastest kid on the block, you're going to need all the help you can get. Unfortunately Greenify is very unintuitive in terms of how to use, and takes some trial and error to not interfere with things like background music playback. But the reward is freeing up resources for things you need to do.- Install a graphical CPU monitor that runs in the status bar, so you can see when it's being chewed up apparently doing nothing. (I like ""Tinycore"".)- Don't install a ""task killer"". It actually slows modern Android versions down. You want to have a wee bit of free RAM at all times, but don't be alarmed at high RAM consumption in general.HOW TO ROOT- Step 1: Go to Google Play- Step 2: Search for ""KingRoot"", if not found jump to steps below.- Step 3: Install it- Step 4: Run it- Step 5: Follow the super-easy stepsKingRoot seems to come and go from the Play Store. If it's not there:- Step 1: Search internet for KingRoot apk from a regular computer. You'll probably find the KingRoot website.- Step 2: Download a recent build.- Step 3: Ignore your local computer warnings about a virus. While KingRoot has some very concerning issues that can be mitigated (see below), this isn't one. KingRoot contains countless known kernel exploits, targeting various device builds and versions. Kernel exploits can be used to attack and infect, but are also the only way to root most phones with locked bootloaders.- Step 4: Transfer KingRoot apk file to your phone (via ADB, or Dropbox, etc.)- Step 5: Enable ""Unknown Sources"" (Under Settings -> Security.)- Step 6: Install the KingRoot APK.- Step 7: Disable ""Unknown Sources""Keep the KingRoot adb file on your phone, you may need to reinstall it later. (E.g. after an OTA update.)After you have KingRoot installed, you'll should really de-fang it. KingRoot is incredibly invasive, worringly so. Unfortunately it seems to be the only way known to obtain root on this device. (I've tried a few other methods, none worked.) The main worry for me is that it installs an ""Accessibility"" service. As an accessibility service, it can observe the contents of any screen (and phone home). It also disables the pattern lock on boot if you've encrypted your phone (still encrypted but less secure), and prevents ""OK Google"" functionality. (The latter two problems - while annoying and concerning - are mainly side effects of having any accessibility service enabled. I don't think it's a purposeful malicious thing done by KingRoot.) If you disable the KingRoot accessibility feature (Settings -> Accessibility -> KingRoot), KingRoot will keep re-enabling itself. There are articles on the Internet on how to replace KingRoot with SuperSU (a trusted tool), but they are targeted to KitKat, and don't work on this phone's Lollipop. But there's still a way to disable the Accessibility service, that I've found through trial and error (and understanding of Android), which seems to have worked so far for me:- Step 1: In Settings -> Apps, locate and uninstall ""Purify"" from your device. (KingRoot installed this all on it's own. The more of KingRoot you can get rid of while still maintaining root, the better.)- Step 2: Disable KingRoot from Accessibility, under Settings -> Accessibility -> KingRoot (this step is probably not necessary).- Step 3: From Google Play Store, find and install ""MyAndroidToolsPro"".- Step 4: Open MyAndroidToolsPro.- Step 5: Under ""Service"", locate KingRoot (sometimes under ""THIRD PARTY"", sometimes under ""SYSTEM"").- Step 6: Disable ""TopAppMonitorAccessibilityService"".- Step 7: Under ""Broadcast Receiver"", locate KingRoot. (Same thing as #5 in terms of where to find it.)- Step 8: Disable ""KSysBroadcastReceiver"".- Step 9: Open Android Settings- Step 10: Under Accessibility, make sure you don't see an entry for ""KingRoot"".You should be good now. Keep checking once in a while under Settings -> Accessibility to make sure you don't see ""KingRoot"".WARNINGS:Mostly related to rooting, updating, and scams- Beware of posts and articles on how to unlock the bootloader. As of today, there is no documented way to do so on this exact phone model. (Though there may be a standard-issue way to do so, with updated tools, in the future.)- Many sites claim to explain how to unlock this phone's bootloader, but if you look carefully, it's not for this phone. They aren't trying to mislead, it's just easy to overlook. (Usually they are talking about the non-""LTE"" version, which has a completely different CPU and chipset architecture and is in no way compatible. If they mention a MediaTek architecture, it's not this phone. This phone is Snapdragon. Altogether different beast. One prominent Google Search result details steps for this exact phone model name, but it's for Mediatek, not Snapdragon, and doesn't work.)- Beware of sites that claim to have a Marshmallow update for this phone. There are at least two of these, that are nothing more than clever scams to put money in their pockets and waste your time. To date, there is no update to Marshmallow.- If you root your phone, and later take an Over-The-Air update, you'll probably brick your phone! But you may be able to unroot, uninstall KingRoot, then update, then follow the steps above again. Be aware that even that is not guaranteed to not brick your phone, or obtain root after updating.- There are some arguments that rooting makes you vulnerable to data hacking even if encrypted, if the phone winds up in hacker hands. This doesn't seem right to me, given my understanding of Linux and specifically dm-crypt. I do know that a casual user can't get your data if you enable encryption. On Linux computers - with wide-open ""bootloaders"" and full disk access, there is no known exploit to compromise the combination of dm-crypt, given a strong enough key. So I doubt encrypted Android can be compromised - rooted, unlocked - or not. Assuming you use a strong key.- If you want to encrypt your phone (a really really good idea), do so before rooting. If you rooted first, just unroot, uninstall KingRoot, encrypt, then follow the rooting steps above again.","44","helpful"
"BLU WIN HD LTE - 5.0"" Windows Smartphone -GSM Unlocked - White","BLU","109.99","4","Great phone. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, let me also say that I am posting this review twice. Once under Blue and Yellow. I bought the Blue and returned it. I missed having a Yellow phone. A few of the pictures I am sharing between the two reviews.I bought this phone on 2/13/16 and as of this post, the phone has been selling since then for under $100. A great value.Under pros I would say the phones lite weight and comfortable design.Under things I would say are a little less the pro, but not a Con, would be the lack of feedback on the back, home and search buttons. All in all, not a big deal. I quickly got use to this. The camera is also adequate. It is not a Lumia Pureview camera, but then again the phone does not have a high end Lumia price.I only have one real Con for this phone: the volume of the ringer. It seems low, and I see another review commented on that also. I have mine turned all the way up to 10. On my Lumia 630, I had it at 5.The phone comes packaged with some EXTRA VALUE!!! The phone includes a screen protector and silicone case. Very nice.Lastly, this phone is Windows 10 Upgradable. The update was released on 3/17/16. The pictures of the Yellow phone home screen is Windows 10. The Blue Phone home screen is Windows 8.1 Sorry the pictures are not the best.","44","helpful"

"BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - Orange","BLU","149.83","5","I purchased this simply because it was on sale for $79 - you can't beat that, based on the good specs, right? In this case, the build and operating quality exceed expectations, and match that of $300 phones (and $300 phones from Huawei, Alcatel, ZTE are pretty darn good these days).Some set-up notes to help you:1. Make sure you have your old phone backed up - Android and Apple phones back up automatically. If you have photos and videos set to auto-back up on your old Android phone, they will be there for you when you log into your new phone. I wouldn't factory reset your old Android phone right away, though, just in case. If you are coming from an older iPhone, things get a little trickier. Apple iCloud isn't available on an Android or Windows phone, so you need to make sure your pictures and videos are backed up to an alternate service - Dropbox, Box, Microsoft OneDrive, Flickr or the best yet, Google+. Telling you how to do that is beyond the scope of this article, so research it online or enlist a friend's help (it can be as simple as downloading the app, signing in, telling it to upload, and being patient). Once again, don't reset your iPhone until you feel comfortable.2. You need a Gmail account to sign in onto the phone. You probably already have one, otherwise you can sign up on the phone itself.3. You need to put a SIM in. Probably in SIM slot one - read the tiny manual in the box. I'm presently trying this out in tablet mode, so I don't have the answer on the tip of my tongue. But one thing for sure - on most dual SIM phones, only one SIM can use high speed data, so it DOES make a difference. (The other SIM will probably use slower 2G data.)4. I don't recommend backing up from your old Android phone's online Google backup. It may take a little extra time to remember and manually install your favorite apps, but it's a cleaner way to install, never hangs the phone (I've had some phones just stall out), and is like spring cleaning - you'll find some apps you never use, just hogging up space.5. This is a pretty stock Android user interface, thankfully, with practically no bloatware programs. That's welcome in terms of housekeeping, and essential in terms of making the most of your 8gb of storage. I had about 5gb before downloading my apps and 4gb after, no SD card installed yet (I have a card on order from Amazon now).6. If you are going to install a micro SD card, there are good deals on Amazon, with Samsung and Sandisk very popular. 32gb goes for about $16 and 64gb goes for about $32. Class 10 UH1 at a minimum is best, and no biggie in terms of premium. Amazon's own stock - not marketplace - is the most reliable. Install the micro SD FIRST before booting up, and before you download any programs, go into Settings- Storage-Install Apps to SD card and select that option; if you don't, you can't move programs to the SD card later, without re-formatting the SD card AND factor re-setting your phone OR uninstalling then reinstalling the app. You want to use the SD card for apps and storage as much as possible to reserve on-board storage for the many programs that won't install to the SD card.7. For some strange reason, the stock keyboard is AOSP (Android Open Source stock keyboard) but I downloaded the Google Keyboard, which has swipe text entry as an option, from the Play Store. Unfortunately it kept crashing on me, ymmv, but be forewarned. Fleksy worked fine.8. To get rid of vibrate on keypress, you need to toggle options in TWO places: the keyboard settings for your default keyboard, found under ""Language & Input"", and the sound settings, of all places, under ""Audio profiles"". Root around in those two categories and you can un-check the appropriate boxes.9. While you are in ""Sound,"" un-check the box for enhancing the speaker sound; all this does on mine is make the speaker crackle at a middle volume level - with the box un-checked, it sounds like most other speakers in smartphones. It isn't a weak speaker, btw, at least not on my sample.10. In the ""Display"" setting category, turn off ""screen adjust mode"", because this has a nearly 3000 mAh battery and you shouldn't be sacrificing ANY screen quality to eke out a little more battery life. On the other hand, I left ""ClearMotion"" turned on, this is a ""Video fluency enhancer"" whatever that means, but if I end up finding the video a little weird, I'll turn it off. (This is non-standard function, btw.)11. Go into the ""Battery"" setting category and un-check the ""CPU power saving mode"" which throttles your octa core performance to ""conserve battery life and lower device temperature."" If you don't like your resulting battery life, you can turn it back on later. Please note that I turned this feature off, but when I came back to write this review, it had turned itself back on, so keep an eye on this setting.General comments:Phone box included good looking, white earbuds (no soft silicone tips) that remind me of the first Apple earbuds.Phone box also included a translucent, thin, medium soft (not gummy) silicone case with perfect fit, perfect cut-outs, easy to operate volume and on-off covered sections; a spare screen protector (there is also one pre-installed, perfectly, no bubbles); a 5 watt, super narrow (narrower than Apple or Samsung cube) charge; and a white, medium short, USB cable.I got about 27,000 on one Antutu test run and 28,000 on another.The translucency of the included case is just right so you can see the phone color but the BLU logo is subdued.The phone is super narrow for a 5.5"" screen, the side bezels are super narrow. BUT, there is a lot of bezel on top and bottom. Net result, the phone probably couldn't be any narrower, and the slim case doesn't add much to that, but it is much taller than it needs to be.The attached screen protector is clear, smooth, and doesn't seem to affect screen color or viewing quality. Since I distrust these things, though, I removed it after giving the phone an initial workout. Turns out glass underneath is pretty grabby, the grabbiest ever with an Amazon screen stylus. You won't notice this if you use fingertips, like most people. BUT if you like to use a stylus, try for a while before removing the screen protector. Since the glass doesn't appear to be oleophobic (oil hence fingerprint resistant) expect to clean the screen more often than with some phones.Since I haven't dropped a SIM in yet, I can't speak to cellular call quality, but I tried Skype and Google Hangout calls in both regular and speakerphone modes and everything sounded great.Rear cover of phone snaps on perfectly with no mismatched cover-to-body spots.Screen seems of good quality, but give me a couple of weeks and I'll update.My initial reaction is that this is a carefully designed, well-thought out, well-built phone. BLU did a superb job here.","47","helpful"

You won't notice this if you use fingertips, like most people. BUT if you like to use a stylus, try for a while before removing the screen protector. Since the glass doesn't appear to be oleophobic (oil hence fingerprint resistant) expect to clean the screen more often than with some phones.Since I haven't dropped a SIM in yet, I can't speak to cellular call quality, but I tried Skype and Google Hangout calls in both regular and speakerphone modes and everything sounded great.Rear cover of phone snaps on perfectly with no mismatched cover-to-body spots.Screen seems of good quality, but give me a couple of weeks and I'll update.My initial reaction is that this is a carefully designed, well-thought out, well-built phone. BLU did a superb job here.","47","helpful"

"BLU Q170T Samba TV Unlocked Dual SIM Quad-Band GSM Phone (Black/Red)","BLU","19.78","5","I do not rely upon a cell phone heavily, unlike most people I know. I only use mine to text my kids or make very occasional phone calls. Thus, I have a T-Mobile pay-as-you-go plan, and as a Gold Rewards customer, I only pay about 10-20 dollars for my phone annually! I bought this phone just because I wanted something smaller than my previous (and older) Nokia. I slipped the T-Mobile SIM card in, and everything worked perfectly. Everything seems to be working fine, the FM radio does a pretty good job, but the TV feature doesn't seem to be able to bring anything in except a fuzzy Spanish channel, if I'm lucky (I live in Orange County, CA). All in all, I can't complain about this phone, it does what I need, but if you're a more sophisticated consumer, you may need something more powerful.","48","helpful"

"BLU Studio 5.0 Unlocked Dual Sim Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)","BLU","104.99","4","My HTC One X bit the dust and I needed an affordable replacement.PROSThis phone delivers all the functionality and Android OS user experience I need. Very happy with the design and engineering of the phone.CONSThe user manual is flimsy and really doesn't come near showing you how to full set up and use the phone. Further, the folks at BLU Products do not want to provide tech support. All they offer is an e-mail address. I sent an inquiry one week ago and have not yet received a response. This means you need to buy the phone from a reseller that is committed to tech support.","49","helpful"

"BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Blue","BLU","18.93","5","I just got this phone and this review is based on my first impressions. This phone gives you a lot for the money. You cannot compare it to the Nokia phones at the same price range. The software/screen/extras are way better. FM radio is a blast! Very clear even without any external headset. In contrast, my new Moto G 2015 does not give you this good reception without a headset. Display is very nice - big, bright, smooth and colorful . Navigation is quite intuitive after 5 minutes playing with the phone. Performance is good. I cannot comment on its call performance since I am only using it with an international sim to receive text messages. The cover is very easy to remove but I found the battery pretty hard to remove. The manual does not indicate how to load the SIM though there is impression embedded near the SIM card compartment. I used a video on YouTube to confirm that I was doing it correctly. Hint - Insert the first sim all the way in until it is flush with the border. Link to video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7nqUw0g7QMI think the phone back could be more textured to give a better grip.","50","helpful"

This model is 8 GB storage with radio bands best for the United States with HSPA+ up to 42 MBPS speeds. The D534U is 4 GB storage with radio bands best for the United States with HSPA+ up to 21 MBPS speeds. The D534L has radio bands better for international countries. I'm not certain of the storage or data speeds.*For reference I am coming from 2 years use of a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 & 1 year use before that of a Samsung Galaxy S 2.*Responsiveness -I haven't noticed any lagging. Again, I bought the 8 GB. I have my Samsung Class 10 32 GB micro SD card installed. I would even say it's slightly more responsive than my Note 2. I don't do any gaming. I check email, browse the internet, shop, edit Google Docs & Sheets, etc, and of course make phone calls & send receive sms/mms.*Data speeds - If you're experiencing slow data speeds, do not rely on the automatically configured settings when inserting your SIM. Check with your carrier for the proper settings. My phone displays 4G. I have not noticed slower speeds compared to LTE on my previous phone. This may be due to the responsiveness of the processor.*Sound & volume - Speaker volume is just fine for calls. I don't have anything negative to say. For watching videos, I've needed to turn it down slightly.*Fits well in my smaller hands. It can definitely be used one handed with no modifications. Lighter weight.*Screen viewing for videos, texts, & pictures is fine. No issues. I was concerned about the slightly smaller screen from my Note 2 (5.5 to 5.0), but it's no adjustment at all.*Color is a neon yellow, not like a banana yellow, but not like glow in the dark neon. It's a nice looking phone.*Accessories - The box it came in is plastic & really nice. The case, headphones, & charger are all adequate. I installed the screen protector (bubbles underneath from dust but that's not Blu's fault) & it doesn't take away from the quality of the screen.*Keyboard - I did have to download the Google Keyboard from the Play Store to get gesture typing. Not a problem at all.*Camera - I use a DSLR for my main camera, but I do want my phone to have a capable camera. Lots of settings or just use auto scene detection. Definitely not as good as my sister's iPhone 6 & maybe not as good as my Note 2, but I would feel comfortable printing out 4x6 prints taken with this phone.*Durability - I dropped it on black asphalt the first day. I was very disgusted. Screen did not crack. I do see a small pin dot size chip, but I can't feel it when I run my finger over it. There is a black, plastic bezel around the screen which ended up with a minor chip that can't be seen when holding the phone at an arm length distance & can not be seen with the case on.*Battery life - I am not having the battery life issues others have had. I do plug it in when I'm home & not directly using it. There is battery left over at the end of the day, & I fully charge it overnight.*Bottom line - I just really can't find anything to complain about with this phone. I wasn't expecting much for $119 but I think it's as good as my Note 2 that costs me $550 2 years ago. My daughter is wanting a new phone when she heads to college in the fall. Her Samsung Galaxy S Relay has slowed down significantly even with 2 factory resets. I'm encouraging her to look into one of these instead of spending several hundred on another Samsung.","52","helpful"

I wasn't expecting much for $119 but I think it's as good as my Note 2 that costs me $550 2 years ago. My daughter is wanting a new phone when she heads to college in the fall. Her Samsung Galaxy S Relay has slowed down significantly even with 2 factory resets. I'm encouraging her to look into one of these instead of spending several hundred on another Samsung.","52","helpful"

Switching or at least crossing over from the Apple side of things is a challenge. One week in, I m enjoying the experience and will continue to use this phone unless I find any reason not to.First off, for a phone that costs less than $200, the usability if reasonable. Be warned that some updates are needed out of the box and some settings probably need to be tweeked to each user's liking, but hey, thats why one gets an Android phone right? the Freedom to customise!That said, Ignore the trolls who bash with one liner's... its actually a pretty decent phone with a lot going for it.PLUSES:Durable glass screen is durable and responsive (corrected from original review which indicated Gorilla Glass... sorry not on this model). It comes with a screen protector already installed AND a spare in the box.Speed is adequate for standard use but if you game or use lots of apps simultaneously, you may want a more premium phone.Attractive basic candybar smart phone that's easy to hold, easy to use, not slippery or prone to dropping. Comes with a silicon rubber case that is good enough.LTE and 4G is fast!HD screen is noticeable differnce to the non-HD model. DO NOT CHEAP OUT.Average:Good build quality despite that plastic back. Feels solid once you get it all set up.UI with KitKat comes with all the pluses and minuses of suchScreen color is good as is brightness.Call quality is good and holds signals well in urban areas.NEEDS WORK:the GPS system is a bit sketchy as on Google Maps or WAZE, the fix wouldn't hold until i did a full reset, used GPS Fix apps AND reloaded A-GPS info. This was with all accuracy setting set to high. This is the ONLY question still in my mind as to whether this particular phone is an acceptable replacement as my primary phone. The GPS readings on Googloe Maps and Waze are SLOWER than that on my IPhone 53 despite a day or tweeks and fixes. Will see about this...Battery life is also mediocre with standard data use, it requires daily charging for me to be safe.Overall, a great deal for less that $200 out the door, lights attractive and with a little time invested up front when setting it up, this Blu Studio 5.0 HD LTE is a solid unit and so far is working as advertised for me.Hope this helps!UPDATE: June 13, 2015After months of usage and throwing it around, the phone is holding up quite well. The screen remains intact and nice and clear with the original screen protector in place. I have NOT found a suitable phone case other than just the silicon rubber one that came with it (was hoping for a billfold type that would allow it to stand) but that said its been holding up quite well!The GPS sucks. Plain and simple it may be an Android thing but it loses lock regularly and is virtually unusable as a GPS nav unit except under the best weather scenarios. The fact that I am complaining about it living in California while undergoing a drought should tell you how poorly I think that part functions. That all said though, for most folks it wont matter and the phone functions well and has not crashed out on my yet.Highly recommend uploading GoogleNow to replace the launcher that came on the phone.","52","helpful"

"BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White","BLU","429.99","5","Received this yesterday, free one-day shipping on Prime! This is the third Blu phone that I have tried, and it is by far the best one. The others that I tried were unsatisfactory, one mainly because it was a Windows phone, and so it really was the OS that was the problem and not the phone itself, which was a fairly decent piece of budget hardware, and the other because it had a slow processor and 1GB of ram which made it lag like crazy.LIKES:Build: I love the thinness, which is at first rather alarming especially before you put the plastic protective cover on the back. The dibbled surfaces of the cover gives it a better surface for gripping than the smooth glass back. It is VERY light, and you will probably do a double-take when you realize that is the weight of the entire phone and it's not missing a battery! It feels surprisingly solid too.Speed: This is one of the very rare Blu phones that has a decent processor and 2GB of ram, which makes a world of difference from most of the the lower-budget phones that the company makes. I have not experienced any perceptible lag so far.Battery life: Today was my first full day of use for this phone. It was charged overnight and unplugged at 07:30am and at time of writing (10:30pm) it is at 40% battery, and the phone estimates it has 9 hours of juice left. I'd say that's pretty impressive. I made about 5 phone calls, sent plenty of text and whatsapp messages, checked FB and Google search, and played some games for about 20 minutes.DISLIKES: The main downside to this phone is the lack of expandable memory, but I don't fill up my phone with music or photos that much anyway, so it's ok for my needs.Conclusion: I know it's only been one day, but I'm really liking this phone that easy on the pocket in more ways than one!","52","helpful"

BUT, It is a real pain in the ass to get the sim and straight talk all working together. I love this phone BETTER than my Galaxy S4! It's interface is soooooo simple. It really is made for human beings! It does not come pre-tethered to facebook or virtually any other apps for that matter. but that is nice because u get to pick and choose ur own apps from Google Play. This phone was $300 cheaper than my Galaxy. The screen resolution is beautiful. No hesitation or lags in videos. It looks and feels like a solid well-built phone. My brother has the exact same model and he loves his too. The camera is high definition and looks wonderful. I actually had to turn my brightness down just to save battery. It is almost too bright and vibrant. Just turn the brightness down a litttle bit. It saves the battery too. With very moderate use after 2 charges, I am able to get two full days out of the battery. Do yourself a huge favor and buy this phone. Except for the setup aggrivation it will blow u away. Also... make sure one of ur first downloads is an app killer, otherwise the device will run out of memory. Just keep hitting that app kil;lert everytime u use the phone and u shouldn't ever run out of memory.","53","helpful"

"BLU Q170T Samba TV Unlocked Dual SIM Quad-Band GSM Phone (Black/Red)","BLU","19.78","3","I needed something easy when I traveled to China and Australia. Easy to put a sim in, and works, but within a month I found I could no longer hear the caller unless I put it on speaker phone- and if I put in ear plugs I could hear them but they couldn't hear me! So some glitch went on there. Great, however, for texting and plans in other countries are cheap for that. Overall, it lasted while I was overseas, but that was a few months - and with the last couple as speakerphone only. So that's something to consider. It's cheap, it won't get stolen, and it does get in TV to watch while waiting for planes/etc. Nothing fancy, but gave me a life line so I wouldn't get stranded.Another downside, as mentioned, is that it's really hard to navigate and the instruction manual is very very limited.","54","helpful"

My gripe with the 7.0 is that it lags a bit in some games, but never bothered the primary user so I know from the start that I will not be buying it. I was torn between the┬áBLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Silver┬áand┬áBLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - US GSM - White.

Of course, Amazon says those phones are Lollipop upgradeable but IΓÇÖd rather not wait.

It is gorgeous, has great battery life, and performs like a champ in the games. ItΓÇÖs even better than the BLU Studio 7.0 II in gaming. The Phone performed as expeted with Speedtest both in mobile and WiFi. It maintains a strong signal (AT&T Prepaid) even on areas where my Samsung completely lose all signals.

"BLU Studio XL Android Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - White","BLU","99.99","5","I purchased this phone as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas because he is having to use a tiny flip phone since his Samsung note died. The packaging was very nice. It included headphones, charger, screen protector, and a case which spared me some extra money on buying a case for the phone. Overall I was very impressed with the packaging. The phone isn't bulky or heavy and it fit in my hand nicely. We both have used Samsung Notes for years and have loved them. I decided to take a leap of faith and order a cheaper phone with a large screen. He didn't use any of the special features on his note so as long as he can surf the web and make calls that's really all that matters to him. The screen resolution wasn't bad but some of the app icons were a little fuzzy looking. The phone seemed to run smoothly and responded well to my touch. Overall it isn't as glitzy and packed with features like the Samsung Note but it is still a great phone. When it comes time to replace my phone I will definitely be opting for one of these. You can't beat the price.","54","helpful"

This is to me the thing I like the least about this phone. In standby the battery will last mind you, but once you're using it to, let's say, instant message via whatsapp and facebook with a little gaming and music in-between, you'll get around 6 - 7 hours...that's what I've seen so far...since it's an 8-core processor with mediatek, I was expecting stellar battery life...but screen on time hasn't impressed me much in as much as it is limited to within 12 hours instead of within 24 hours...they could have done alot better with the battery...hopefully the update will make better use of battery or maybe they could create a better 2000 mah or perhaps a larger mah (2500 mah) battery to fit the phone...(still, consider the price...it is better or as good as many other devices out there at the same price)7) The speaker is very clear and clean...loud enough too for my liking and the phone itself comes with a beautiful music player that offers several sound effects like 'plate reverb', 'large room' etc along with different play modes like classical, dance, hip hop, pop, etc...I said before that 'I don't feel the desire to get another player from google play store' but I redownloaded fusion music player which allows users to cut a song at any point to make a desired ringtone(it also allows online content and other useful features so...)...With respect to the speakers though, I do think that they probably could have placed it at the front considering how much bezel that is present below the capacitive buttons or they could have placed a smaller one there...but it works well on the back nonetheless...(lean it onto something solid when playing videos and the sound resounds beautifully)8) The WI-FI antennae seems pretty strong...I was travelling around with this and it's been picking up WI-FI signals from homes as I passed by with more than a few bars...it connected to my home WI-FI very quickly...9) Call quality is very good...I only made a few short calls so far but individuals hear me clearly and they sound clearly also with no background noise and no drop calls...so far so good. There is a setting that allows me to suppress my background noise during calls too.10) Both cameras function well and take clear pictures...the flash on the back is bright enough to take good pictures at night...the interface is minimalistic and clean...one issue is that whenever the video icon is touched the camera automatically starts recording video...don't know if I can change this in the settings yet but I'll keep looking into it...11) I haven't tried out the bluetooth as yet so I can't say how stable it is in use yet...12) The headphones aren't so special...don't expect to experience the best sounds from them but they are good enough and come with a mic...13) Something I noticed is that when using the screen for typing I sometimes have to press the same area 2-3 times or wait for a second or two to get a letter out...I went into audio settings and disabled the vibration feedback and it helped a little but it still happens though less frequently...it's therefore one of two things: (i) It's a software problem which can be fixed with the update or (ii) My particular phone has a minor fault...still this doesn't take away from the usability of the phone since it only happens ever so often and lasts for 2-3 seconds...14) I ran antutu benchmark several times and the highest score I ever got was 28,887...RAM usage is great and shows up better than most phones in comparison (3084 vs 1387 on the galaxy s4)...15) It may take some time to get used to the position of the capacitive buttons...their background light goes off after only a few seconds without interaction and I sometimes had to search a bit for them...in a well lit area, there isn't a problem seeing them without their background light on...I think that we should be allowed to change how long they light up for though...hopefully that is included in the update...All-in-all this phone works...and there is no need to pay 400-700 us dollars on a brand phone like Samsung or HTC when you have blu coming through with so much to offer at an acceptable price...compared to the moto g at the same price you get alot more value for money.UPDATE(Dec-15-2014): I've been using the phone for a few months with minor issues until now: I'm finally in a position to really try the bluetooth but so far I'm very disappointed; I've tried it with several bluetooth devices and am yet to get a stable connection...that sucks since I really use bluetooth of recent including my computer which works just fine with the bluetooth usb device I ordered from Inateck. Other than the bluetooth, another issue I think needs be resolved is the lack of ability to make the power button a camera snapper (and the pictures are amazing btw)...sometimes it's hard to snap oneself having to search for the exact point on the screen to touch with ones finger...in addition, it seems to change settings every now and then with regards to my music ringtones (though I suspect my music app may have something to do with that): the ringtone I use changes on its own for whatever reason.I hope BLU resolves all these issues because with all these things I don't think this phone is worth the $200 they are asking for- especially considering that other phones in their line-up are cheaper without these issues.

"BLU Win JR 4-Inch Windows Phone 8.1, 5MP Camera, Unlocked Cell Phones-White","BLU","54.99","5","Hello everyone, I just got my Blu Win Jr a couple days ago after I saw this phone and I looked up the spec sheet and I returned my Nokia 635 after I had it for a week. For essentially 40 dollars less you get a phone with more features to it than the Nokia. I love the Blu Win Jr and I would highly recommend it over the 635 for the following reasons.- Front facing camera. Granted it is a VGA front camera and the quality is mehh but a front facing camera that you can video chat and take selfies with is something the Nokia 635 can not offer.- Flash. They both have a 5 megapixel camera however the Blu has a flash. This is so important considering the fact that you can take low light photos on it and use flash light apps on it.- Bundled Accessories. When I had the Nokia 635 I wasn't only gonna pay 130 for the phone but I also had to consider the case and a screen protector which would have taken the phones price close to 180 dollars. The Blu Win Jr does good service to the customer and includes a silicon case and two screen protectors, one of which COMES Installed. WOW! if that isn't good service from a phone company then I don't know what is.- Price. Blu comes with all the accessories you need for 89 dollars where the Nokia is gonna run you about 180 when you take everything into consideration. Double the price for less value for the money? No thanks, not to take anything away from nokia phones because I LOVED the 635 but I just feel like the BLU is better bang for buck in my opinion. The performance is also pretty good since its windows hone 8.1 which has really low spec requirements so the Blu Win JR just zips through basic tasks (twitter, email, music player, youtube, snapchat, instagram) I don't play games on my phone so I cant comment on that.- Verdict - REMEMBER THIS ISNT A FLAGSHIP PHONE, don't go buying this expecting the performance of a NOKIA 1520. However if you are looking for a phone that does the basics really fast and don't mind taking a risk on a new manufacturer then I whole Heartedly recommend this over Nokia's budget phones. This phones has more features at a low price point. I would recommend this over a moto g, nokia 521, moto e, nokia 635, and all those other good quality budget phones. Most people don't need to spend 700 dollars on a phone (iPhone Users) to get the job done. This phone is exceptional for 89 dollars. I LOVE BLU PRODUCTS NOW","58","helpful"
"Blu Studio C Mini Quad Core, 4.7"" IPS, Android 4.4 KK, 4G HSPA+, 5MP Camera - Unlocked Cell Phones - White","BLU","79.99","5","THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE BLU STUDIO C MINI, NOT THE C HD. The two devices are, however, very similar, and everything in this review applies to the C HD except the C HD has more ram, a better screen, and 2 full-size SIM card slots. However, I feel a 5 inch screen is just a little bit too big to use with one hand, so I recommend the C Mini. SPEED: This phone is FAST. The 512 megs of ram prevent games such as Asphalt 8 from running, but the Android UI and games like Subway Surfers and even slightly more intense games run very fluidly. The 1.3 Ghz quad core processor is no slouch, either. BATTERY LIFE: The battery is good, and even comparable to my LG F3s 2,460 MAh battery. With little-moderate use, it will last a long time. Heavy gaming will deplete the battery in 5-6 hours(With Wifi and GPS on). Oh, and did I mention the phone charges from 0-100% in 1 hr 40 minutes? OS/UI: This phone is pretty much Stock Android (Kitkat 4.4.2) with a couple nice extra features, such as scheduled power on and off, a battery charge time indicator, an apps to SD function (Disabled in Stock android since 4.0), and even a built in, OS integrated Antivirus. Blu has made Android almost perfect. (Only having the phone come factory rooted could make it better) SCREEN: The screen is nice, crisp, and bright. It has pretty good viewing angles, may be... 160 degrees or so. It doesn't seem at all pixelated, even with such a low ppi (200 or so) The screen is well calibrated and very vivid. CALL QUALITY- Call quality on TMobiles network is good, and the phone even supports video calls (Though my SIM doesn't) SPEAKER- The speaker is quite loud, but sounds tinny. It works well on speakerphone, but wear headphones or use external/Bluetooth speakers for music. I tested wired external speakers and headphones, and it had really good sound quality (It even supports a 5.1 surround system without a receiver. CAMERAS- I don't take photos with my phone, but I tested the image quality out. Quite frankly, the back camera is pretty bad for 5 megapixels and autofocus. It can read QR codes though, and that's all I need it for. The front camera is useable, at least for Skype and selfies. BUILD QUALITY- The device is built quite well, and does not feel cheap (With the case on) I asked a friend how much he thought it cost, and he guessed $550. Wow. 3G/HSPA+ Its quite fast. I've gotten up to 7.4 mbps on HSPA+(4G) on TMobile, and 4 MBps on 3g. My LG Optimus F3 (4GLTE) got 13.4 in the same location, but the point is, its useable. It also uses less battery than LTEODDS AND ENDS: The Gyro sensor is not calibrated, so games that don't have a ""Calibrate"" button (Like Temple Run) you will have to play while slightly lobsided. I will update this review with a fix if I can find one.The phone comes with a pair of terrible headphones(With a mic attached), a screen protector, a case(Which adds that more premium feel and protects only the back and sides from scratches), and a wall charger+ USB 2.0 cable.The phone supports OTGThe phone allows you to Hotspot/tether your phone on any carrier, even if the carrier doesn't allow it (Because the Hotspot app is part of Android itself)The phone does have a LED notification lightAnd also the brightest flash/flashlight I've ever seen on a phone.VERDICT: Do not hesitate to buy this phone. For $120 unlocked, you cannot go wrong... Unless you want the 2015 Moto E, which is also fabulous. I will review it soon.On the main Amazon page for the C mini, it shows, say, a black and white phone and labels the color as yellow. DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE PICTURES. The color of the actual device is what the label (under ""In stock"") says.(I think this has been fixed by now)If anyone has any questions at all about this device, ask it in a comment to this review, and I will answer (Also with a comment) as fast as possible.9/1/14 UPDATE- I have just discovered the Stock launcher keeps removing all the apps on the SD card from the home page (On boot). A simple fix for this is to download Nova Launcher.The GPS, albeit accurate, depletes the battery in roughly an hour and a half. Because that's the same time it takes it to charge, the battery will only remain level if the phone is plugged in with GPS in use.It boots up in 10 SECONDS if you turn on the fast boot setting!!!! (This can be found under Settings/Accessibility/Fastboot)Update 10/26/14:The phone still runs strong, though I have needed to purchase a new screen protector. The Youtube app from Google sticks sometimes due to lack of support, but there are other Youtube apps out there, so no biggie. Battery life is still good. The capacitive buttons seem to lag a second or so, can be fixed through Onscreen Buttons (On Play Store) The LED on the back doubles as the BRIGHTEST phone flashlight I have ever seen, though it does get hot after long periods of use.****** After I put in my new SIM card, SMS messages wouldn't work. A simple solution is to go under Settings/More/Wireless & Networks/Mobile Networks/Network Operators. Tap ""select manually,"" ""Ok,"" then ""T-Mobile 3g"" (4G HSPA+ is technically a version of 3g). You may have to wait a minute while it searches for available networks. Then restart the phone (Hold power button, then reboot/ok) THIS WILL LIKELY ALSO WORK FOR OTHER CARDS AS WELL. I also realized the SIM 1 slot is the HSPA+ slot, and the other is normal GSM.***Update 11/5/14*** My phone's back camera now has a small hairline crack. This is likely because the camera actually sticks out PAST the included case... So it is the first point of impact on a fall to the back. The camera still functions and the crack is virtually invisible both to me and the phones camera (It does not appear in photos). Also, now that Android L (Lollipop) has come out... I can speculate that I will never get an OS update... I haven't gotten one in three months. Lets hope they send out the update eventually. Meanwhile, my Nexus 9 is... Well... Android has never been better.Also, sometimes I boot up my phone and it unlocks itself. Other times, it sets Avast off, thinking I have removed the SIM card because the second card is not present. The upside to this is that avast locks my phone on boot... :-P The downside is the alarm noise, which I have overwritten with a recording of absolute silence. So it sorted itself out.Final Update... RIP Blu Studio C Mini.I have managed to kill my phone through rooting. If anyone wants to play with root, beware. The phone can be rooted through the free Kingroot app (It's in Chinese, but it is quite straightforward nonetheless.) ROOT AT YOUR OWN RISK. Rooting caused system crashes and randomly occurring reboots. There are no custom roms or forums for this phone... There is no stock rom image available to download online. Also, updates become locked after rooting, even if the phone is unrooted.In short, DO NOT ROOT IT.UPDATE, 9/5/2016: I managed to save my phone by flashing a Micromax Android L rom onto it. I commented on the website that it worked, and they actually created a webpage about it months ago (which is pretty amazing, I've never ported a rom before.) Anyway, now there is a rom to use if you've rooted your phone and want to upgrade to Cyanogenmod Android L. It has some bugs, and I can't code well enough to fix them. The biggest issue is that it no longer accepts SIM cards, and I've been unable to fix that thus far, although I promise I will work on it. Here's a link: [...]With that said, in 2016, this phone is absolutely no longer worth it.**I said I would post again when I figured out how to recalibrate the gyroscope. Well, I figured it out. If you boot the phone into factory mode (Hold down power and volume down on boot until a menu appears) and use the volume down key to highlight ""Item Test"". Then, press menu (the soft button on the bottom left of the screen). Use the volume down button to highlight ""G-Sensor Calibration. "" press the menu button to select it. Then press the menu button again to calibrate the sensor. Make sure the phone is on a flat surface during calibration.To reboot the phone into normal Android, press the back button repeatedly until you are back to the main factory mode menu. Use the volume down button to highlight ""Reboot. "" Press the menu button to select it. The phone will then boot up normally. Don't worry if it takes a little longer than usual this time or tells you that ""Android is upgrading"".Update 8/24/15 - I was curious to see what had happened with the Studio and I was surprised by how popular it is for a generic brand phone. I just wanted to throw a couple new thoughts out there. (1) The phone no longer holds a full charge, and replacement batteries are impossible to find. (2) The phone MSRPs for $120, not $200. (3) If you can spend $85 on a phone, go buy the 2015 Moto E. It is so much better than the Studio C Mini at a very similar price.I will not update this review again (It's really long), but I am always open to answer any questions you may have.","59","helpful"

I will update this review with a fix if I can find one.The phone comes with a pair of terrible headphones(With a mic attached), a screen protector, a case(Which adds that more premium feel and protects only the back and sides from scratches), and a wall charger+ USB 2.0 cable.The phone supports OTGThe phone allows you to Hotspot/tether your phone on any carrier, even if the carrier doesn't allow it (Because the Hotspot app is part of Android itself)The phone does have a LED notification lightAnd also the brightest flash/flashlight I've ever seen on a phone.VERDICT: Do not hesitate to buy this phone. For $120 unlocked, you cannot go wrong... Unless you want the 2015 Moto E, which is also fabulous. I will review it soon.On the main Amazon page for the C mini, it shows, say, a black and white phone and labels the color as yellow. DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE PICTURES. The color of the actual device is what the label (under ""In stock"") says.(I think this has been fixed by now)If anyone has any questions at all about this device, ask it in a comment to this review, and I will answer (Also with a comment) as fast as possible.9/1/14 UPDATE- I have just discovered the Stock launcher keeps removing all the apps on the SD card from the home page (On boot). A simple fix for this is to download Nova Launcher.The GPS, albeit accurate, depletes the battery in roughly an hour and a half. Because that's the same time it takes it to charge, the battery will only remain level if the phone is plugged in with GPS in use.It boots up in 10 SECONDS if you turn on the fast boot setting!!!! (This can be found under Settings/Accessibility/Fastboot)Update 10/26/14:The phone still runs strong, though I have needed to purchase a new screen protector. The Youtube app from Google sticks sometimes due to lack of support, but there are other Youtube apps out there, so no biggie. Battery life is still good. The capacitive buttons seem to lag a second or so, can be fixed through Onscreen Buttons (On Play Store) The LED on the back doubles as the BRIGHTEST phone flashlight I have ever seen, though it does get hot after long periods of use.****** After I put in my new SIM card, SMS messages wouldn't work. A simple solution is to go under Settings/More/Wireless & Networks/Mobile Networks/Network Operators. Tap ""select manually,"" ""Ok,"" then ""T-Mobile 3g"" (4G HSPA+ is technically a version of 3g). You may have to wait a minute while it searches for available networks. Then restart the phone (Hold power button, then reboot/ok) THIS WILL LIKELY ALSO WORK FOR OTHER CARDS AS WELL. I also realized the SIM 1 slot is the HSPA+ slot, and the other is normal GSM.***Update 11/5/14*** My phone's back camera now has a small hairline crack. This is likely because the camera actually sticks out PAST the included case... So it is the first point of impact on a fall to the back. The camera still functions and the crack is virtually invisible both to me and the phones camera (It does not appear in photos). Also, now that Android L (Lollipop) has come out... I can speculate that I will never get an OS update... I haven't gotten one in three months. Lets hope they send out the update eventually. Meanwhile, my Nexus 9 is... Well... Android has never been better.Also, sometimes I boot up my phone and it unlocks itself. Other times, it sets Avast off, thinking I have removed the SIM card because the second card is not present. The upside to this is that avast locks my phone on boot... :-P The downside is the alarm noise, which I have overwritten with a recording of absolute silence. So it sorted itself out.Final Update... RIP Blu Studio C Mini.I have managed to kill my phone through rooting. If anyone wants to play with root, beware. The phone can be rooted through the free Kingroot app (It's in Chinese, but it is quite straightforward nonetheless.) ROOT AT YOUR OWN RISK. Rooting caused system crashes and randomly occurring reboots. There are no custom roms or forums for this phone... There is no stock rom image available to download online. Also, updates become locked after rooting, even if the phone is unrooted.In short, DO NOT ROOT IT.UPDATE, 9/5/2016: I managed to save my phone by flashing a Micromax Android L rom onto it. I commented on the website that it worked, and they actually created a webpage about it months ago (which is pretty amazing, I've never ported a rom before.) Anyway, now there is a rom to use if you've rooted your phone and want to upgrade to Cyanogenmod Android L. It has some bugs, and I can't code well enough to fix them. The biggest issue is that it no longer accepts SIM cards, and I've been unable to fix that thus far, although I promise I will work on it. Here's a link: [...]With that said, in 2016, this phone is absolutely no longer worth it.**I said I would post again when I figured out how to recalibrate the gyroscope. Well, I figured it out. If you boot the phone into factory mode (Hold down power and volume down on boot until a menu appears) and use the volume down key to highlight ""Item Test"". Then, press menu (the soft button on the bottom left of the screen). Use the volume down button to highlight ""G-Sensor Calibration. "" press the menu button to select it. Then press the menu button again to calibrate the sensor. Make sure the phone is on a flat surface during calibration.To reboot the phone into normal Android, press the back button repeatedly until you are back to the main factory mode menu. Use the volume down button to highlight ""Reboot. "" Press the menu button to select it. The phone will then boot up normally. Don't worry if it takes a little longer than usual this time or tells you that ""Android is upgrading"".Update 8/24/15 - I was curious to see what had happened with the Studio and I was surprised by how popular it is for a generic brand phone. I just wanted to throw a couple new thoughts out there. (1) The phone no longer holds a full charge, and replacement batteries are impossible to find. (2) The phone MSRPs for $120, not $200. (3) If you can spend $85 on a phone, go buy the 2015 Moto E. It is so much better than the Studio C Mini at a very similar price.I will not update this review again (It's really long), but I am always open to answer any questions you may have.","59","helpful"
"Blu Studio C Mini Quad Core, 4.7"" IPS, Android 4.4 KK, 4G HSPA+, 5MP Camera - Unlocked Cell Phones -Black","BLU","70.4","5","THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE BLU STUDIO C MINI, NOT THE C HD. The two devices are, however, very similar, and everything in this review applies to the C HD except the C HD has more ram, a better screen, and 2 full-size SIM card slots. However, I feel a 5 inch screen is just a little bit too big to use with one hand, so I recommend the C Mini. SPEED: This phone is FAST. The 512 megs of ram prevent games such as Asphalt 8 from running, but the Android UI and games like Subway Surfers and even slightly more intense games run very fluidly. The 1.3 Ghz quad core processor is no slouch, either. BATTERY LIFE: The battery is good, and even comparable to my LG F3s 2,460 MAh battery. With little-moderate use, it will last a long time. Heavy gaming will deplete the battery in 5-6 hours(With Wifi and GPS on). Oh, and did I mention the phone charges from 0-100% in 1 hr 40 minutes? OS/UI: This phone is pretty much Stock Android (Kitkat 4.4.2) with a couple nice extra features, such as scheduled power on and off, a battery charge time indicator, an apps to SD function (Disabled in Stock android since 4.0), and even a built in, OS integrated Antivirus. Blu has made Android almost perfect. (Only having the phone come factory rooted could make it better) SCREEN: The screen is nice, crisp, and bright. It has pretty good viewing angles, may be... 160 degrees or so. It doesn't seem at all pixelated, even with such a low ppi (200 or so) The screen is well calibrated and very vivid. CALL QUALITY- Call quality on TMobiles network is good, and the phone even supports video calls (Though my SIM doesn't) SPEAKER- The speaker is quite loud, but sounds tinny. It works well on speakerphone, but wear headphones or use external/Bluetooth speakers for music. I tested wired external speakers and headphones, and it had really good sound quality (It even supports a 5.1 surround system without a receiver. CAMERAS- I don't take photos with my phone, but I tested the image quality out. Quite frankly, the back camera is pretty bad for 5 megapixels and autofocus. It can read QR codes though, and that's all I need it for. The front camera is useable, at least for Skype and selfies.

"BLU Studio XL Android Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - White","BLU","99.99","5","All I can say at this time is, So far so good! It is replacing another Blu 5.5 Studio I purchased from Amazon about a year ago. But after about 6 months, the video started flickering and running lines through it. So when I saw Blu had an updated Studio XL with a 6 inch screen I jumped on it.Although it has a 6 inch screen, Android 5.0 Lollipop takes the bottom half-inch or so of the screen for the ""buttons"" that used to be fixed below the screen. This is a bad move on their part to advertise a 6 inch screen, but only 5.5 inches viewable. So not much improvement over a 5.5 inch smart phone. Also it should be noted that this is not a HD screen. At 960x540 screen resolution, it is subpar with comparable smartphones in this category, but most are more expensive. It has a beautiful screen non-the-less. But for the average viewer, most will not notice the lower resolution unless using it with Google Cardboard 3D viewing. But I'm sure that is a very small percentage of buyers. I inserted a 64 GB micro SD card which it accepted, formatted and allowed me to transfer most of the installed apps to it freeing up the limited 8 GB of internal memory. I then took the SD card out, inserted it into the adapter, then into my computer slot to fill it up with my tunes, pictures and vids. It plays everything just fine with jetAudio basic for the tunes, VLC Player for the vids, and the included apps for the pics.Recommended!Update 4-6-16Using this phone in Colombia & Panama. Works nice with Claro data plan + minutes for 15 bucks a month in Colombia. & 22 bucks a month for +Mas Movil Panama. Good H+ but no 4G so far in either country. MagicJack app seems to have bug, as folks on other end hear their echo. Don't have that with my iPhone 4s. I will reinstall app to see if newer firmware fixes it. Using Speedtest been getting over 10mgs with H+ in both countries. Another problem I encountered when I first arrived in Panama, was calls & msgs seemed to default to Colombia SIM, even when Panama SIM was chosen as default SIM. So just took out the Claro SIM, as probably Claro has overriding firmware to keep it primary in multi-sim phones. Or at least that's what the +Mas Movil tech says in Panama. So the phone is still hanging in there. No real complaints so far. Still recommended!Update 29 Jun 2016Just returned from the Dominican Republic, used Orange SIM & phone worked beautifully. Also just bought from Amazon the PNY 128 GB micro SD card for less than 30 bucks. Removed the 64 gigabyte SD card from my phone, placed it in its adapter and backed it up in my laptop. Inserted the PNY 128 GB SD card into my phone, turned it on. Phone recognized the new card right away and asked me if I wanted it formatted. Which I did. Turned off the phone removed the new card, placed it in its adapter and put it in my laptop to copy the data back to the new card. Inserted it back into the phone and turned it on. Phone recognized it immediately. So no problem with 128 GB SD card with this phone! More tunes, plus just about every picture I've ever taken!Update: 3 July 16Bought from Amazon the Anker double fast charger along with a six pack of their charging cables. I recommend you don't use that Anker charger with this phone. I had missplaced my original Blu charger and cable and began using a cheap generic charger & cable, but was taking forever to get a decent charge. Maybe 60% overnight. So bought the Anker combo pkg. Works super fast charging this phone, but stops at 99%. Phone started acting up which I determined was due to overheating while charging with the Anker charger. Long story short, found the original Blu charger, and am sticking with it. The Anker cables work great with the Blu charger as does the original Blu cable. Blu charger charges in about 6 hrs to 100%. Stick with the Blu charger and cable!","60","helpful"

"Life Pure Mini Quad Band Unlocked (White)","BLU","120","5","Most budget friendly phones have to sacrifice somewhere. The Moto g has a bad camera, most of the mid-range LGs for T-mobile have limited memory and the Alcatels of the world offer terrible screens (my opinion) while others skimp on batteryBUT- Blu has managed to somehow make what I believe is the perfect midrange that doesn't make any sacrifices. I spent a lot of time looking at tech specs in reviews and what I've realized is for the average person, they are extraneous. So I'll avoid those and talk about the actual experience.SCREEN: If this isn't right, the internals don't matter. Fortunately, this is gorgeous. Like HDTVs, once you hit a certain pixel density, it all kind of looks the same. The pixel count here is high enough that you can't see any (i.e. ""retina"" quality) and the color reproduction is on point. Blacks look black, whites look white, etc... My wife has an iphone 5s and I can't tell a difference (honestly I feel the colors pop more on the Blu)UI: The Blu LPM is running Android 4.2 but you wouldn't know it. Nothing about the UI screams android- in fact the overlay has it operating more like iOS, which is very refreshing. It gives it some character and separates it from the sea of stock androids that are usually pretty lacking in soul. Transitions are smooth and operating the phone is incredibly intuitive. I had an xperia Z (returned b/c the 5 inch screen was just too unwieldy) briefly with 2 gigs of ram and I can't tell a speed difference at all. Google apps are nicely integrated and holding down on the home button takes you straight to Google NowCamera: This is an area most midranges skimp in and one I didn't expect much from. However, I am pleasantly surprised. The camera boots fast (you can go from locked to snapping a picture in approx 2 seconds by accessing it straight from the lock screen) and takes crisp pictures with accurate colors. The front camera is excellent as well, taking clear photos that manage to make great use of available light without looking grainy.Sample shots: [...]Battery: Absolutely beastly. I've been using the phone pretty well constantly since getting it so I'm unable to speak to daily usage but while using apps, surfing the web, or watching videos expect it to drain only 10% an hour AT MOST. Blu claims 36 hours of mixed use and I believe this phone could really go two days of normal use without needing a charge. An almost miraculous feat in the world of android (especially in the midrange!)**UPDATE**- After two weeks with this phone I'm consistently getting 2 full days of regular use (approx 1-2 hours of web a day coupled with light gaming and texting and occasionally some music) and the phone is typically still alive upwards of 40 hours after I've taken it off the chargerFeel: The phone is nicely curved and fits really well in hand. It is thin, reasonably light (although not a featherweight) and feels premium. It's always nice when something feels more expensive than it actually is (instead of the opposite) The buttons are placed well and I really like that it has capacitive buttons along the bottom. They are responsive and disappear nicely when not in use.Sound: Good grief this thing gets loud. It wouldn't matter if it didn't maintain clarity but it does. It is without a doubt the loudest/clearest smartphone speaker I've ever dealt with. You won't be disappointed here. The included headphones are also a nice surprise as they pack great mids and deep bass all with a flat cord that won't tangle.Gaming performance: This will run all of your basic games perfectly fine. I've even been able to try out some more intensive games (Riptide GP2) and it has run them without issue as well- even with the water drip effects and allfl. If you just play angry birds and flappy bird and whatever other avian gaming masterpieces come out- you'll absolutely be fine.Data Speed: I'm running this on T-Mobile and am consistently getting HSPA + speeds. That basically means its fast and pages load nearly instantly. The lack of LTE is really not a huge loss in my opinion. I can stream music and watch videos without any hitches, at some point the extra speed is just that- extra. The Blu LPM is fast, and that's all that really matters.Extras! Blu is going to do well as a company because they give you more than you expect. Included with the phone are a screen protector, clear shell, and a nice pair of headphones with a flat cord and volume control. It's a nice touch.Overall: I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better phone even upwards of $100 of the Blu LPM's $220-ish price tag. It's got a lot of character, looks great/feels great, has plenty of memory, an outstanding battery life, and two great cameras.**Also, in doing research before buying this phone I found out that Blu is based out of Florida-another plus! support this American company!**","61","helpful"

This is definitely a budget ""close to flagship"" cellphone.-Design-as a nice nice and premium feel design. Mine is the grey color, and it comes with a blue plastic wrap on the side, which I decide to keep it as the blue and silver seems to be good match to me.-Performance-So far it has been doing super good, I am not sure why people talk s*** about this chipset, but everything is super smooth, well, it could be lagging fro a second or 2 if you perform lots of task within a small period of time, but it is totally acceptable.-Battery-Battery has been good to me, I usually unplug the phone around 8am, it will be around 80% at 6pm if you leave it mostly standby, and if you constantly using the phone for facebook, instant msg and calling it still have approx 50% by 6pm, which is pretty amazing to me. Please do note that battery is non-removable-OS-It comes with Android 6.0 with some heavy skin, I have no problem using it so far, and one good thing about Android 6.0 is that if someone thinks 64Gb is still not enough storage for them, they can plug in a sd card and have it format as part of the cellphone internal storage. Please noted that if you do this route, the SD card will not eb able to removed from your phone, or it could cause certain app not functioning, another thing is that SD card do take up one of the sim tray which means you will be giving up the dual sim feature. DO NOT EXPECT BLU TO UPGRADE YOUR PHONE TO 7.0.-Camera-Pictures quality is pretty good with good light condition, would go a bit fuzzy if taking pictures without enough light however. One thing I notice is that that the viewing angle for te rear camera is a bit narrower than what I would expect-Screen-The screen is beautiful, I am a IPS guy and yet I still like this screen a lot. The brightness is decent enough that you can see your screen clearly under direct sunlight.-Audio-The speaker is located at the bottom instead of the back of the phone, which is a big plus to me with the fact that the speaker is very loud and clear. Do not expect to hear great music with this audio output however, watching short video or making speaker call would be good for sure.-Accessaries-It comes with a screen protector, a silicon case, which is standard to most Blu product, on top of that it also comes with a USB charger, a USB Type-C cable, a headphone, a sim tray opener, and a ""standard USB to Typc C convertor"". I am a bit puzzle about why they would provide a USB to Type c convertor, but not a micro-USB to Type C convertor, as most of the phone/tablet use micro USB plug for charging purpose, which would be way more useful than the ""USB to Type c "".-Gaming-I am not a big cellphone gaming person, but I do have a few games installed, so far I have Toy Defense, Geometry Dash Lite, Growcastle and Pokemon go installed, and they all working very smoothly. And yes, Pokemon Go is fully functional for this phone, which is a good thing as I heard Vivo 5 was not able to run Pokemon Go-Others-1) I did see someone mention the sim tray does not take nano sim card, which is actually wrong. IT DOES TAKE NANO SIM CARD, in tray 2 only, and you have to place it vertically. I have attached a picture to show how the nano sim card to be placed. The user manual also show how to place the sim as well.2) I also see people complain about loose home button.Mine is totally fine, the clicking sound does make it sounds loose, but that seems more likely the button design then really loose, it would wabble a bit if you try to pushing it left and right; however, it still seems totally fine to me. That being said, it is still a question on how durable the button will be. We will have to see how long it takes until it die out.3) Please do note that the phone does not have brand 12 for t-mobile user, if your area has recently been upgraded or only have band 12 available in your area, then you are out of luck. If t-mobile has been working at your around past 10 years you should be good, if t-mobile has only improve in your area during past 2-3 years, you may have to gamble it a bit.4) and no, this is a GSM only phone, it will not work for Sprint, verizon and all VMNO that use their network such as virgin, boost, ringplus.In conclusion, this is a very solid daily cellphone, with the current $300 price tag, you would not go wrong with this phone.","63","helpful"

"BLU Win JR 4-Inch Windows Phone 8.1, 5MP Camera, Unlocked Cell Phones-White","BLU","54.99","5","Just received the phone and am very impressed with the features you get for the price. It includes earbuds with a mic, gel skin and two screen protectors! I am still in aww of how fast this unit is compared to the Lumia 520. Its snappy and the screen is bright. The build quality is good and the removable battery and micro SD slot are a plus. It is a dual sim phone and surprised me that it takes the larger sim card. Overall, I would recommend this as a entry level phone that performs well and has two cameras and one flash. You will need a SD card if you want to load apps, music or take pictures and video.

So I decided to check out the lineup of Blu phones available at very inexpensive prices, expecting that it would be a ""holdover"" phone till I could get my next flagship (or flagship killer) device.The thing is, the sub-$130 phone I now have in my possession doesn't feel like a sacrifice. The look is eye-catching and sleek. I'm amazed at how thin it is. It has a nice weight in the hand. And where the device does cut corners, it's not as bad as you would think. The 720p screen is just fine to my eye. The quad-core mediatek processor isn't the greatest, but it holds up to music, games, watching YouTube videos, and most of the functions you would want to perform with your smartphone, with only the occasional stutter or lag. The storage space, while rather limited, can be expanded via MicroSD.Then, there's what really blows me away. The 4,000 mAh battery! Especially considering the thin and elegant look of the phone, it's hard to believe there's so much battery packed in this device. I can use the phone, rather heavily, from morning till night, and still have 75% - 80% left.I am beyond happy I got this for my replacement phone, and I would recommend it for anyone who wants a budget phone with premium good looks, decent specs, and amazing battery life.

"BLU PURE XR Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +4GB RAM - Gold","BLU","299.99","3","The Pure XR is a smartphone that BLU claims will give you near flagship experience and for the most part I can tell you that they weren't too off base with that comment. The XR uses a Mediatek P10 processor that when paired with 4 GB of ram is actually not too bad to use. Managing through the custom skin that BLU calls Carefree launcher is smooth and overall a pleasant user experience that many potential iphone users will feel at home with. While we are far from a stock android device, some software features are actually more convenient the way BLU has it outlined. One of these is the relocation of the quick settings onto the bottom of the screen instead of the top like traditional android devices. Many Chinese OEMs do this and since this is a rebranding of a Gionee device, we get that here too. I'm not a huge fan of this tinkering of the settings layout but it grew on me and is actually much easier to access especially with a 5.5 inch device.Build quality is a mixed bag. While we do have an aluminum unibody, the quality of the build is questionable. When held next to other aluminum unibody phones like the OP3 or Axon 7, you notice a significant drop off in quality with the XR. This is accented by the flimsy buttons which are extremely loose and sensitive. At only $100 less than the other two stated phones, this is something that can be overlooked but not ignored in everyday use. I've noticed the volume rockers changing my ringer volume while resting in my pocket because the buttons are just so loose that brushing against my leg would be enough to confirm a click. And while the home button may annoy some due to the fact that simply shaking the phone can make the button emit a cheap loose shaking noise, we can't say the same about the embedded fingerprint scanner which is top notch. I am pleasantly surprised at how accurate this scanner is. Of all the phones I've used in 2016, while not the best, the Pure XR definitely trumps other more prominent phones such as the iPhone SE and Xperia Z5c when it comes to the fingerprint scanner.Everything else regarding the entertainment side of a smartphone is acceptable. The Amoled screen, while not quad hd, is very acceptable and enjoyable to look at with its Full HD display. Colors are rather vibrant and warm which if you've used Amoled before, you will be very happy with. You won't be getting the highest end performance as I've come across hiccups and force crashes here and there while playing games and using the camera, but for $299 I'm okay with the performance hit. I wish BLU could have squeezed the new X20 or an X10 in here over the P10, but at least they gave us 4 GB of ram which makes the P10 usable to say the least.Camera performance is lackluster which is to be expected here. Shots are slow to auto focus and miss almost every time even in good lighting. I've been taking a lot of photos that resulted in soft focus using auto focus on the Pure XR. Exposure also is not the best here. The back camera struggles to keep things in context to color and brightness. The selfie camera while decent in MP count also suffers similar problems to it's back camera counterpart.One of the special features this phone has that only 2 other phones have is what BLU calls 3D touch. Like Apple and Huawei, this is simply a marketing phrase for a display panel that has pressure sensitivity. There really isn't anything you can do with it at the moment other than the peak and pop feature that iPhone users have been accustomed to over the last year. Only a handful of system apps can use the feature and that is only if you are using the Carefree launcher. 3D touch is rendered moot if you download and use another launcher. But props nonetheless for the inclusion of this on a budget phone.One last huge positive to end this review. Battery life is terrific. I dare say that the choice not to use the power hungry SD processors have paid off as the BLU Pure XR has given me godly numbers. I struggle to kill the battery and I am a heavy power user. Whereas the OP3 only averages about 3-3 1/2 hrs of SOT, the XR has been giving me an astounding 5 1/2 - 6 hrs of SOT. I am very impressed.I have to conclude that if you can spend an extra $100 on a phone, you really need to look at the OP3 or Axon 7 as they are much superior for what you pay. But if you must buy a phone in the $299 range, then this is a solid buy. This phone goes to show that we as consumers have another option in the lower to mid end spectrum of the smartphone market which used to be flooded with unusable phones. What BLU has been doing this year with their devices is showcasing that while not flagship level, lower end devices can still offer glimpses of excellence where the user may question if they are using a $800+ phone.","66","helpful"

"BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Gold","BLU","134.95","3","This was my first blu product experience.I'll start with the GOOD. The phone feels like a premium phone with a beautiful display of colors on their 6inch screen. And although I didn't install any apps the phone was smooth and fluid when swiping screen left to right. The camera took nice pictures too. And it also comes with 2 cases and also a screen protector. So no need to buy one, I didn't know this so I plan on returning everything I purchased for this phone.Now here's the BAD. Even though it felt like a premium phone, right off the bat I noticed a small area where the AMOLED screen was not glued to the gorilla glass 3 leaving a empty space making that spot look white. With the screen on you can't see it but with the screen off it stuck out like a sore thumb. Another thing is there is no app drawer but whatever. And finally when I put my Sim card in and tried to set my APN in network settings, the option to select networks was there but wasn't highlighted so my clicks did nothing. I couldn't setup the phone and data. Just wifi only.Needless to say I repackaged it and had it ready to return for a refund less than an hour of receiving the phone. Had the screen been perfect and the Sim card was recognized I would have kept it but I'm big on first impressions and blu has failed.","69","helpful"

The camera took nice pictures too. And it also comes with 2 cases and also a screen protector. So no need to buy one, I didn't know this so I plan on returning everything I purchased for this phone.Now here's the BAD. Even though it felt like a premium phone, right off the bat I noticed a small area where the AMOLED screen was not glued to the gorilla glass 3 leaving a empty space making that spot look white. With the screen on you can't see it but with the screen off it stuck out like a sore thumb. Another thing is there is no app drawer but whatever. And finally when I put my Sim card in and tried to set my APN in network settings, the option to select networks was there but wasn't highlighted so my clicks did nothing. I couldn't setup the phone and data. Just wifi only.Needless to say I repackaged it and had it ready to return for a refund less than an hour of receiving the phone. Had the screen been perfect and the Sim card was recognized I would have kept it but I'm big on first impressions and blu has failed.","69","helpful"
"BLU Studio Selfie 2 - GSM Unlocked Smartphone - Grey","BLU","69.99","4","Bought the blu advance 5.0 for my 13 yr old in January. Him being 13, of course dropped it several times, so screen cracked in several places. And it wouldn't store anything even with a 32gb card. Couldn't get screen repaired so I decided to buy the Blu Selfie. My son loves it! Better pix and storage! !! And it did come with a screen protector and a outside lil rubber gel case. Ok for the price too.","72","helpful"

"BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Blue","BLU","18.93","4","I like this phone. My regular cell is an iPhone. I got this as an international travel phone because it is cheap, simple, unlocked and dual SIM and has a long battery life. It takes full size SIM cards. Inserting the SIM cards isn't immediately obvious. The instructions are useless. I figured it out by carefully studying a little icon impressed into the plastic above the battery compartment. Taking the cover off to get to the SIM cards is a little bit of a pain to take off and put back on again. You'll need a microSD card if you want to take pictures. I previously had the Tank T190 and liked it. This is an incremental improvement except for getting to the SIM cards. If you are going to frequently change SIM cards I wouldn't recommend this phone. Otherwise, this make a great little travel phone or backup phone.","77","helpful"

"BLU Life Pure Unlocked Phone (Black)","BLU","150","4","So I've been looking at Android phones for a couple of weeks now - I'm an iPhone user since the first generation and have been an ""apple person"" since then. I wanted to look at Android, gain a larger screen and have a lower cost option as a backup in case my iPhone 5s ever went down or was stolen.It took about a day to get the apps I was used to using on the iPhone from one of the android marketplaces (Amazon or Google), move over contacts and customize the look and feel of the device - once that was done I began to ""road test"" the phone for a few days to see if I could make a go of it and to see if or where there were any gaps in functionality or usability between what I was used to in iOS and Android. In the first couple of days I was concerned that I may not be able to find some of the more critical apps I had been using on the apple device on android - with only a couple of exceptions (Amazon Prime Viewer, the Zmodo security camera viewer were really the only exceptions and those weren't deal breakers).The positives first: The screen is large and in charge. The display is very clear at most angles, the pixels per inch and off angle viewing IS impressive. The layout of the physical buttons and capacitive options, home and back buttons are fine though the lighting of those buttons does go off after a short period of time - you probably won't notice after using the phone for any length of time so that's not really an issue. The specs are decent - quad core processor, 2GB of RAM, etc. I've had no issues with the device locking up or freezing. The modified interface isn't that bad - I think that I would prefer stock Android and hopefully BLU won't make that many changes to KitKat when it becomes available for OTA update. Since BLU isn't a top tier phone manufacturer they almost have to include screen protectors and covers - you're probably not going to find more than a couple options even on-line for this device. I have the black version and it's a nice satin or mat finish - it doesn't attract finger prints and seems easy to clean when smudges do appear. WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular all seemed to work fine though artist, track, and album info doesn't display when BT streaming is done via spotify as other devices work in that area.Here's where the BLU LIFE PURE looses a star: The cell data speed isn't full 4G (LTE) - this isn't a deal breaker in my opinion for a couple reasons - the first is many carriers only support 4G speeds in limited areas and with limited devices. I'm on AT&T and get pretty decent speeds with a Samsung Note 3 and Apple iPhone 5s - those are both top tier smartphones that would cost twice as much as the LIFE PURE off contract - the second reason is that in most places I'll be using this device I have access to WiFi. I'd also ding the device a star for it's ""smallish"" battery and no option to replace it - 2000mAh probably won't work for even the most occasional use user - it reminds me of having to find a charging cable for an iPhone after an update where the battery life was reduced dramatically. In my opinion I would gladly give up a millimeter or 3 for a larger battery or even better a replaceable one. The audio over Bluetooth streaming or even connected via the 3.5mm jack is very ""flat"" and has little dynamic range - coming from an iPhone (which is really an iPod with a phone when it first was introduced) I didn't realize how spoiled I was with the built in EQ. Problem solved with a couple free EQ apps on the marketplace. Lastly while 32GB of storage isn't bad more would be nice and a SD slot would be best. The camera - megapixels do not equal great pictures and this smartphone proves it. For pics within a few feet and with a little fiddling in the camera app's settings you can take decent snaps but get beyond 8ft. or so and indoors you'll probably be taking some blurry anything but sharp shots. As stated before what can you really expect out of a phone at this price point. You don't have to pack your point-and-shoot camera if you have an iPhone or Nokia Lumia or top tier Android (Samsung, HTC, or even LG) with this phone I wouldn't leave home without that extra camera if you want to get decent pics - this device is a phone with a camera not a camera phone.The limitations listed above that caused this device to receive 4/5 stars are pretty much known things going in to this purchase or could be worked out with some work and downloading - the battery (capacity or not being replaceable) is probably it's biggest most fatal flaw. If I were in close range of a USB charger and knew I wouldn't be taking many pics or was taking along a dedicated camera I could see this as a daily driver.Going forward for my next Android device I'll look for the following:-Replaceable battery (only non replaceable if it's a ""monster sized"" battery (3000mAh or bigger)-A micro SD slot that takes 32GB or larger cards - even though I'm not an MP3 ""fiend"" being able to use the device for storage is a nice feature that Apple doesn't openly support. Fully loaded up with apps, pics, and music via Spotify I'm still at about 10GB free and there are cloud solutions to help out - having my own content though is king when you're on a plane or where there's no WiFi.-Approx. 5"" display - this device has made me a convert to larger than 4.5"" ones.-A top rated camera - I don't really care about megapixels as long as it's better than 5MP-gorilla glass or equivalent - as large as these displays are getting it's only a matter of time before a crack or drop happens-Stock android - ROM manager doesn't seem to recognize the BLU LIFE PURE and I'm concerned about the few locations where custom ROMs are available - BLU has stated that KitKat will be available shortly but that would a couple months ago.I'll report back later as to how the device performs over time.","81","helpful"

"Blu LIFE 8 Unlocked (Orange)","BLU","169.99","4","I was unsure about my purchase on this device seconds after purchase. I have tried many budget android devices in hopes of finding a low cost but high performing tablet or phone. Lets say that I haven't been too lucky.Over the past 2 weeks I have been researching all of Blu's phones and I thought I had found the one! I was looking for 4 things I wanted most from a phone.1. SD Card. Memory is a big one for me as I have a large music collection and don't want to waste my data on streaming music. What I need is a device that is compatible with 128GB micro sd card and this one is. The Amazon description says up to 64GB, I was very happy to see that 128GB worked. I did have one issue and it could have been the app I was using but I had to tell iSyncr app to send the music to the internal memory not the SD card to get the files on the SD card. Very Strange but it worked.2. The display had to be as good as a iPhone 4. I can't use any display that isn't IPS and low resolution. If I place my phone on my desk and look at it from a extreme angle I want it to look the same as looking directly at it. This phone has a great screen, I would rate it a 9 out of 10. I was very happy with the quality of the IPS display. The bright vivid colors and the touch input was dead on every time. The one place that it did disappoint me was in the OS, the gradients where not smooth so not sure if this was Ice Cream Sandwich or the display.3. Speed!!! Budget Android devices lag very bad when scrolling through large blog posts or any page with a lot of pictures. The speed of the Octa core processor didn't disappoint me. I have a very large music collection and running Player Pro in album view scrolled and rendered album art very quickly.4. Battery life. I really can't talk to much about the battery life as I have only used it for two days. The first day the battery had 50% life out of the box. After charging it to 70% I started loading on the apps and using wifi to transfer my music over to the sd card in the phone. the wifi transfer ran the battery down very fast and had to be plugged in before it ran out.The biggest disappointment and the reason why I sent this phone back to Amazon is that I couldn't get the Bluetooth to stream audio smoothly. I have Bluetooth in my car and the music skipped like a scratched cd. This could be a bug in the Ice Cream Sandwich rom ""The phones OS"" and could be fixed when the phone gets the Kit Kat update.Overall I love this phone and would have kept it if the Bluetooth worked. If Blu updates this phone to Kit Kat I may try this phone again to see if the problem has been fixed.Not sure if it's possible but stock Google play rom on this phone would make it shine and remove any quirks I found like no access to quick toggles in the notification pull down menu. A extra gig of ram would have really helped in a few places too.","84","helpful"

"BLU Energy X 2 - With 4000 mAh Super Battery - Global GSM Unlocked Smartphone - Gold","BLU","109.99","4","Great Phone so far. It's nice having an unlocked phone. I'm using this phone on ATT it was very easy to set up. First charge the phone with it's adapter or any Android adapter that's not type C. Install your Sim card into slot 1 which is the metal one. It's located towards the left side face down below the camera. Then if you have an XD card it goes right over the top of the Sim's card. After that you can restore your contacts and App's thru your Google Account. Load the app's that you use the most without any of your carriers memory and battery hogging app's. The camera's are good but not exceptional. See the two photo's that I took of my dog with them bellow. The first is the selfie camera and the second is the main camera. The good: Very nice feel of the phone,fast great display and exceptional battery life. The number 1 reason for replacing my Motorola phone. For the price even my son was impressed with how nice it was.(I told him I would get him one if he improves his grades.) LOL The bad: It comes with a rather flimsy case that's slippery,so I'm on the look out for something better. But being an off brand there's not to many out there. All in all I have no regrets about my purchase. I do recommend this phone for price,feel and performance.","87","helpful"

"BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Gold","BLU","134.95","1","Incredibly deceitful company and discourteous customer service. Product doesn't work. Hate it. Very dissatisfied; livid. Bought the Pure XL on Dec 15, 2015. Despite the phone being in *pristine* condition - no scratch, no dents - on Feb 19, the LCD suddenly displayed a set of pixels and nothing else (see attached photo). We called customer service with photos and they accused us for the problem additionally claiming the phone was out of warranty. We sent it in for repair, $100 out of pocket cost, assuming we did cause the problem. Now $450 sent to BLU. Got the phone back in our hands today - it won't turn on. Nothing; dead cold technology. We plan to call BLU on Monday to troubleshoot and hopefully they will be able to get it running with remote instructions, or exchange the broken product for something that works. I'm willing to change the rating in this device review if the company *owns their problems* and stands behind their products. If past experience is an indicator, the future is not looking good.Why on Earth should I feel nervous about calling BLU to get a working device? Because my going-in position is: they will again wrongly accuse me of damaging the device, and in order to get a working device it'll cost me *another* $100, bringing the total cost to $550 for a device that should have costed the advertised $350... and there is *still no guarantee* that it will work if it goes through the ""repair"" process again. If I wanted a $550 device, I would have purchased a device from another company - one that stands behind their products. We really hope BLU stops blaming the consumer for their manufacturing defects, or they will find that people simply won't purchase them. It would seem impossible for BLU to retain customer loyalty with this kind of treatment.","87","helpful"

My screen protector is defective though, it has a streak on it after removing the second layer. See the pics. At this price point 8 gigs memory with 1 gig ram with the case etc is good. It does not have a front facing flash. It does not have 5ghz wifi. It does have a good screen with decent viewing angles. It detected a T-Mobile sim I put in.

"BLU Life View L110X Unlocked 5.7-Inch 16 GB 12 MP Camera Phone(Blue)","BLU","150","5","I did have a Blu Quattro 5.7 but after 2 weeks the ear speaker went out. I returned it and got this one. I was hesitant since there is no Micro SD Card slot. However, I am using Google Drive and storing all my files and music on there.In the box was: The phone, earbuds with several size buds,instructions, charger and USB cable, screen protector, and a cover. This is one of the first unlocked phones that I got from Amazon that the box seal wasn't broken.Its very sturdy and fits nicely in the hand. I love the fact that it has Gorilla Glass.The phone as a great camera. Its a huge improvement over the camera on the Quattro. I also love the updates to the Android OS. It is smooth and very responsive. I like how you can setup the security to use your face to unlock the phone or a phrase.I installed a couple of programs that you might want to check out (free):1. Advanced Task Manager. This kills running programs and frees up the phone memory.2. Open Mic+. I'm experiment with this. Its an add on for Google+ so that you can do hands free voice commands. Similar to MotoX3. Clean Master. This will automatically tell you when to move installed programs from the phone memory to the larger section of the phone memory. It also cleans up the storage and gets rid of junk files. Very good program!On most of the Blu phones, they state that there is an FM radio. I've had the Blu 4.5 Quattro, 5.7 Quattro, and this phone. This is the only one though were I found the FM radio. It is great reception! You must use the earbuds in order for it to work. I suspect because they act as the antenna.The phone network speeds on this phone is improved over the 4.5 and 5.7 Quattro, due to improve protocol.Things I dislike about the phone:1. No Micro SD Card slot (No biggie since I am using Google Drive).2. They divide the phone memory into two partitions. A .99gb and a 12.83gb partition. The main partition is the .99gb one. I have tried to figure out how to combine them but have been unable to yet. I don't know why Blu does this. You have to carefully manage your installed apps or you will quickly run out of room. That's why I recommend Clean Master.3. The battery can not be removed. I guess that once the battery dies,you have to contact Blu to see about them replacing it or you just throw it away.4. The screen dims automatically after about 15 seconds. I have tried every setting and every program on the Play Store to prevent this. Nothing works. You must constantly touch the screen to keep it at full brightness. I don't know if its a Jelly Bean thing to save battery life or a Blu hardware setting. It's annoying but I've gotten used to it. Note: It won't dim while watching a video.5. Blu still hasn't come out with any cases for their phones!!!!! COME ON BLU!!!!Overall, a great phone. I think it's the best Blu phone that I've tried so far.I found a great case on Amazon....http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J53YW16/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1It is soft rubber and wraps around the back of the phone and the front edges.Also found some great screen protectors for it here on Amazon.....http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJHPMHC/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Just follow the instructions. I installed mine with no bubbles and fingerprints don't show up that easily.","91","helpful"

"BLU Life XL - LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - 16GB +2GB RAM - White","BLU","622.9","4","(29 September 2016) Update: phone's still going strong. The battery life continues to impress as noted below. All this aside, though, this update is to notify prospective buyers that you are stuck with Android 5.1.1 OS. I received an email response about two weeks ago from BLU Tech Support to my inquiry concerning plans for OTA update to Android 6.0. BLU notified me that they did not plan to push the Android 6.0. update to this phone. Thus, if you are itching for the latest and greatest Android OS, this is not your phone. As noted below, Android 5.1.1 is more than capable with its current (and final) stock OS & with some minor differences, you'll be hard pressed to notice the difference from Android 6.0, as noted in my original review.Finally, I noticed the price has gone up in Amazon for some odd reason considering this phone is no longer a top-of-the-line (if it ever was) BLU phone. Shop around, I've seen it for less elsewhere but make sure you get the ""16GB +2GB RAM"" model, its worth the slight price uptick.(March 28, 2016) Others have written exceptional reviews in Amazon for this phone that include specs and other technical details. I will focus more on the daily user observations with some ""tinkerer"" inclinations. I replaced a Nexus 5 after only two years. Having paid $399 for Nexus 5 I expected more and better quality from LG/Google. After two days of having BLU Life XL I reached the conclusion that I will NEVER buy a ""premium"" phone again. This phone has a premium feel for a fraction of the cost. Admit it, if you dropped $400-$700 for a premium phone it is probably in a rubber or plastic case. Your phone is probably running on Android 5.0.x, maybe 6.0 if you have a Nexus. Aside from that, you'll have a hard time finding a compelling difference between BLU and Samsung, LG, or any of the other ""major"" Android phone makers. Cost doesn't necessarily mean quality in many cases; in the phone world I have concluded that the extra money paid for an Android phone is the cost of advertisement for the manufacturer.What difference does this phone have that more expensive Android-based phone do or don't? Build quality? Proprietary OS? Maybe. However, after dropping good change for a Nexus 5 (LG) that started giving me problems after the first year and basically died after a short 2, I am convinced that I had nothing to lose on this BLUE Life XL for only $136. Next to Google's Nexus line, BLU practically runs on a near pure Android OS, which I love. I guarantee that once you experience pure Android, nothing else in the Android universe will suffice. Love bloat? I didn't think so; BLU did not load Android with bloated apps unlike Samsung or LG (non-Nexus). The few apps that BLU loaded can be deleted or turned off easily. Although BLU is running on Android 5.1.1 (and is expected to receive Android 6.0 in 2016), the difference to Android 6.0.1 on my Nexus 5 is not that big of a deal to really tell the difference. My conclusion was this, aside from the plastic and glass shell and screen size of this BLU unit, and one Android version lower, what difference am I seeing to the Nexus 5 (LG) that I just replaced? Nothing really; for a quarter of the cost. Samsung's Android OS is bloated and cost over $500. BLU looks and feels like many of the Galaxies of late before Samsung went with sealed glass or metal cases. I love the fact that the battery is easily accessible and I don't have to reverse engineer the unit to get to the sealed phone when it is time to replace it.The only annoyance--a little--is that the ringer quality at full volume is not very good. You'll need to bring down the volume to about 75% to reduce ""scratchy noise."" The ringer is loud enough at 75% to work fine. It appears as well that the Bluetooth distance/strength is not as solid as my Nexus 5 but these two issues are not deal breakers.I'd say, if you are in need of a new or replacement phone but don't want to pay premium prices (again) for phones that are ALSO running Android 5.0 then go with BLU.UPDATE (April 6, 2016). I've had the phone since March 27, 2016. I still stand by the original posting. I wanted to follow-up with other observations after 11 days of active use. I loved the fact that the phone came with its own rubber case, earbuds, and a single screen protector to get you started. The phone is still holding well.As noted above, the phone comes equipped with a nearly pure Android OS. However, it seems to be build on a Cyanogenmod mod called Trebuchet. Which isn't bad at all, actually. I opted to download Google Now launcher from the Play Store to truly have a pure Android OS-Nexus feel that I had with my Nexus 5 running on Android 6.x.I also tweaked the settings on the phone to maximize battery life and have succeeded beyond expectations. I uninstalled a couple of superfluous apps that came with the phone (I forgot which ones for purpose of this write-up). I also disabled 26 apps (see below) and added a few others that I wanted. I also turned off the notification lights and vibrating features. Finally, I downloaded Doze (YirgaLab) from Google Play Store. Doze (YirgaLab) is for phones that are not running on Android Marshallow (6.0) (Google's Doze comes standard in Android 6.0). Doze (YirgaLab) auto blocks data flows when the screen is turned off and whether or not you are connected to Wifi (you can select the appropriate settings); you can also select with apps to exclude from being turned off by Doze. The combination of uninstalling or disabling apps, along with the installation of Doze (YirgaLab) has resulted in better than expected battery life (helps that the battery is a little over 2800mah). I can go a full day and night on moderate use on a full charge. On slow usage days the batter meter shows that I can go for two days and hours on a single charge. I added screen shots here from different time blocks to give you an idea what might be replicated. Of course, after 12 months I expect the battery to degrade a bit; it will be interesting to see how the battery holds after 12 months.Disabled Apps to help maximize battery use:-Android Live Wallpapers-Android Work Assistant-Black Hole (wallpaper)-Bubbles (wallpaper)-Calendar-Calendar Widget-Cloud Print-Drive-Email-Exchange Services-Gmail (replaced with Inbox by Google)-Google Keyboard (replaced with Go Keyboard)-Google Partner Setup-Google Play Books-Google Play Games-Google Play Music-Messaging (replaced with Hangouts)-Music Visualization Wallpapers-Opera-Opera Preinstall Data-Phase Beam-Photo Screensaver-Print Spooler-Tags-TalkBack-Trusted Face","103","helpful"
"BLU Life XL - LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - 8GB +1GB RAM - Dark Blue","BLU","129.99","4","(29 September 2016) Update: phone's still going strong. The battery life continues to impress as noted below. All this aside, though, this update is to notify prospective buyers that you are stuck with Android 5.1.1 OS. I received an email response about two weeks ago from BLU Tech Support to my inquiry concerning plans for OTA update to Android 6.0. BLU notified me that they did not plan to push the Android 6.0. update to this phone. Thus, if you are itching for the latest and greatest Android OS, this is not your phone. As noted below, Android 5.1.1 is more than capable with its current (and final) stock OS & with some minor differences, you'll be hard pressed to notice the difference from Android 6.0, as noted in my original review.Finally, I noticed the price has gone up in Amazon for some odd reason considering this phone is no longer a top-of-the-line (if it ever was) BLU phone. Shop around, I've seen it for less elsewhere but make sure you get the ""16GB +2GB RAM"" model, its worth the slight price uptick.(March 28, 2016) Others have written exceptional reviews in Amazon for this phone that include specs and other technical details. I will focus more on the daily user observations with some ""tinkerer"" inclinations. I replaced a Nexus 5 after only two years. Having paid $399 for Nexus 5 I expected more and better quality from LG/Google. After two days of having BLU Life XL I reached the conclusion that I will NEVER buy a ""premium"" phone again. This phone has a premium feel for a fraction of the cost. Admit it, if you dropped $400-$700 for a premium phone it is probably in a rubber or plastic case. Your phone is probably running on Android 5.0.x, maybe 6.0 if you have a Nexus. Aside from that, you'll have a hard time finding a compelling difference between BLU and Samsung, LG, or any of the other ""major"" Android phone makers. Cost doesn't necessarily mean quality in many cases; in the phone world I have concluded that the extra money paid for an Android phone is the cost of advertisement for the manufacturer.What difference does this phone have that more expensive Android-based phone do or don't? Build quality? Proprietary OS? Maybe. However, after dropping good change for a Nexus 5 (LG) that started giving me problems after the first year and basically died after a short 2, I am convinced that I had nothing to lose on this BLUE Life XL for only $136. Next to Google's Nexus line, BLU practically runs on a near pure Android OS, which I love. I guarantee that once you experience pure Android, nothing else in the Android universe will suffice. Love bloat? I didn't think so; BLU did not load Android with bloated apps unlike Samsung or LG (non-Nexus). The few apps that BLU loaded can be deleted or turned off easily. Although BLU is running on Android 5.1.1 (and is expected to receive Android 6.0 in 2016), the difference to Android 6.0.1 on my Nexus 5 is not that big of a deal to really tell the difference. My conclusion was this, aside from the plastic and glass shell and screen size of this BLU unit, and one Android version lower, what difference am I seeing to the Nexus 5 (LG) that I just replaced? Nothing really; for a quarter of the cost. Samsung's Android OS is bloated and cost over $500.

"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black","BLU","292.99","3","This phone is part of a 5-Way ""$300 Phablet Showdown"" which includes the following devices:6.4"" Sony Xperia Z Ultra $2996.0"" Sony T2 Ultra $2995.7"" LG G Vista $3095.7"" ZTE ZMax $2526.0"" BLU Studio 6 LTE $279and the winner is....NOT the BLU Studio 6 LTE!!! (NOT BY A LONGSHOT)Sorry, BLU! In My Opinion, this is another wasted opportunity to show that your company CAN be relevant.It's not all bad, but it's not good enough, either!PROS:- The 6"" 1080x1920 screenIt is BIG It has a VERY Sharp picture with deep colors, and it's just plain BEAUTIFUL!- The build quality is as good as ANY phone on the market.With its anti-slip back and rounded corners, this phone just fits my hand, and feels good. The buttons are well placed and they have a great feel, even through the TPU rubber case. With the capacitive buttons below the screen, it allows the usable area of the screen to be just that much bigger. Some people don't like the capacitive buttons, but I prefer them.-16 GB of on board storageExcellent storage for a mid-range phone.- It can use an SD Card up to 64GB...compared to 32 GB for many others in this segment.- Apps can be moved to the SD card to further expand storage.Not all manufacturers get this! Sony phones require a software update to make this work, and the ZTE doesn't get it at all. LG gets it, right out the box.-The Camera takes OK pictures and is responsive...although it's a little difficult to use.So it doesn't have the wiz-bang features of the Sony, but the picture quality produced by this 13MP is MUCH better than the 13MP on Sony T2 Ultra. It far outweighs the 8MP offerings on the other 3 phones in this test, as well.- It has an impressive Antutu Benchmark score of approx. 19000.Higher speed processor and 2GB of Ram help this phone rule the Benchmark score. Only the Z Ultra with it's REALLY fast processor and 2GB Ram scored better.- The screen covers an impressive 73% of the surface area of the phone. This is on par with the best of 2014!- In the Box Accessories!Just like the high end units available today, this phone comes with a wired headset. And, exclusive to BLU, the box also contains a TPU Rubber case, and 2 Screen protectors are included, in the box! (at least $30 value, based on Amazon prices) Some would argue that BLU has to do this because you can't buy aftermarket cases and screen protectors for their phones! This may be true, at least for a while after launch (and this phone is BRAND NEW as of December 8th, I believe!!). Historically, though, BLU phones don't get a lot of attention from aftermarket accessory companies. To be fair, the LG G Vista and the ZTE Zmax will probably never get a lot of aftermarket accessories as well.CONS:-It doesn't operate very smoothly!Paging from one homescreen to another should be a lot more fluid. Pulling down the notifications shouldn't feel 'notchy'. Apps should open more smoothly.... and THEY DO, when you use any of a number of Launchers available on the Play Store. (I had my best results with the Nova Launcher- paid edition for $4.99., but the free version was ok, too.) This tells me that a software update may fix this phone's biggest downside, and and it appears that BLU has made provisions for that with the ""Wireless Update"" link under the ""About Device"" menu in ""Settings"" (I could be wrong, but I don't remember the BLU Studio 6.0 HD having a similar update link.).-Bluetooth v.3.0The specs for this phone are hard to find, but when you do find them, they show that it only supports Blutooth v 3.0! That means it won't work with smart watches and most fitness trackers! Low-energy Blutooth v4.0 has been out for a very long time. The BLU Studio 6.0 HD even had BT4.0! I hope this is simply a mistake in the marketing material. If not, this is a tragedy!-It doesn't have very many LTE Radios.It does have the right radios (BAND4 on 1700/2100AWS) for T-Mobile, but it doesn't have the right radios (BAND17 on 700MHz) for Tmobile's upcoming high speed LTE. It also, doesn't have the correct radios for LTE service in most other countries, or on At&t in the US! Not cool BLU. (again, I hope that these stats are mis-quoted but I don't think they are.)-NO aftermarket development community, that I could find.ROOT and ROMS may never be developed for this phone.- Aftermarket accessories may not ever be made for this phone.It would look REALLY sexy in a Terrapin, Ultra Slim Flip Case, like the one available for the Xperia Z Ultra! Will they ever make one that fits this phone? Probably not.- The specs don't indicate Gorilla Glass!Other BLU phones do have it, so if this is their Flagship, I expect it here... BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IT!- Finally, BLU Tech Support is hard to get in touch with, both on the phone and via email, and THEY DON'T RESPOND TO EMAIL within their 2 day promise!I have asked tech support for info about upcoming fixes and spec clarification (BT3.0???), but BLU has yet to respond.With all these shortcomings, this phone offers a good value in the Sub $300 Phablet Arena, BUT IT's FAR FROM THE BEST VALUE!!! Avoid the frustation and anxiety you get wishing this phone was better, and hoping for fix from BLU that will probably never come!BUY Last year's flagship on Amazon without a warranty. YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!!!","122","helpful"

Some people don't like the capacitive buttons, but I prefer them.-16 GB of on board storageExcellent storage for a mid-range phone.- It can use an SD Card up to 64GB...compared to 32 GB for many others in this segment.- Apps can be moved to the SD card to further expand storage.Not all manufacturers get this! Sony phones require a software update to make this work, and the ZTE doesn't get it at all. LG gets it, right out the box.-The Camera takes OK pictures and is responsive...although it's a little difficult to use.So it doesn't have the wiz-bang features of the Sony, but the picture quality produced by this 13MP is MUCH better than the 13MP on Sony T2 Ultra. It far outweighs the 8MP offerings on the other 3 phones in this test, as well.- It has an impressive Antutu Benchmark score of approx. 19000.Higher speed processor and 2GB of Ram help this phone rule the Benchmark score. Only the Z Ultra with it's REALLY fast processor and 2GB Ram scored better.- The screen covers an impressive 73% of the surface area of the phone. This is on par with the best of 2014!- In the Box Accessories!Just like the high end units available today, this phone comes with a wired headset. And, exclusive to BLU, the box also contains a TPU Rubber case, and 2 Screen protectors are included, in the box! (at least $30 value, based on Amazon prices) Some would argue that BLU has to do this because you can't buy aftermarket cases and screen protectors for their phones! This may be true, at least for a while after launch (and this phone is BRAND NEW as of December 8th, I believe!!). Historically, though, BLU phones don't get a lot of attention from aftermarket accessory companies. To be fair, the LG G Vista and the ZTE Zmax will probably never get a lot of aftermarket accessories as well.CONS:-It doesn't operate very smoothly!Paging from one homescreen to another should be a lot more fluid. Pulling down the notifications shouldn't feel 'notchy'. Apps should open more smoothly.... and THEY DO, when you use any of a number of Launchers available on the Play Store. (I had my best results with the Nova Launcher- paid edition for $4.99., but the free version was ok, too.) This tells me that a software update may fix this phone's biggest downside, and and it appears that BLU has made provisions for that with the ""Wireless Update"" link under the ""About Device"" menu in ""Settings"" (I could be wrong, but I don't remember the BLU Studio 6.0 HD having a similar update link.).-Bluetooth v.3.0The specs for this phone are hard to find, but when you do find them, they show that it only supports Blutooth v 3.0! That means it won't work with smart watches and most fitness trackers! Low-energy Blutooth v4.0 has been out for a very long time. The BLU Studio 6.0 HD even had BT4.0! I hope this is simply a mistake in the marketing material. If not, this is a tragedy!-It doesn't have very many LTE Radios.It does have the right radios (BAND4 on 1700/2100AWS) for T-Mobile, but it doesn't have the right radios (BAND17 on 700MHz) for Tmobile's upcoming high speed LTE. It also, doesn't have the correct radios for LTE service in most other countries, or on At&t in the US! Not cool BLU. (again, I hope that these stats are mis-quoted but I don't think they are.)-NO aftermarket development community, that I could find.ROOT and ROMS may never be developed for this phone.- Aftermarket accessories may not ever be made for this phone.It would look REALLY sexy in a Terrapin, Ultra Slim Flip Case, like the one available for the Xperia Z Ultra! Will they ever make one that fits this phone? Probably not.- The specs don't indicate Gorilla Glass!Other BLU phones do have it, so if this is their Flagship, I expect it here... BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IT!- Finally, BLU Tech Support is hard to get in touch with, both on the phone and via email, and THEY DON'T RESPOND TO EMAIL within their 2 day promise!I have asked tech support for info about upcoming fixes and spec clarification (BT3.0???), but BLU has yet to respond.With all these shortcomings, this phone offers a good value in the Sub $300 Phablet Arena, BUT IT's FAR FROM THE BEST VALUE!!! Avoid the frustation and anxiety you get wishing this phone was better, and hoping for fix from BLU that will probably never come!BUY Last year's flagship on Amazon without a warranty.

"BLU Life Pure Unlocked Phone (Black)","BLU","150","4","Blu has always been known to have decent Android phones. With their Life series they raised the bar and with this Pure phone they hopped over the bar and landed on their two feet. Quad Core processor, 2GB of ram, and 32GB of storage.The phone itself is built like a champ. A solid 1 piece of polycarbonate encloses the phones massive 5 inch full hd display with IPS technology. The camera is 13mp on the back and boy does it shoot and take some good videos and pictures. Easily bests my Nexus 4's 8mp. The phone is slim and it feels really good in the hand. Like I said the build quality is fantastic.It has all the wireless you want, but with no NFC. 2.4 gHz bands for wifi only. GPS and bluetooth are here (4.0) So why did this only get 4 stars and not 5?Very simple. The GPU on this is two years old. The powerVR graphics card. Now that is not bad for a device with a 720p display or lower, but when you are pushing 440+ PPI, you need a more powerful one. The CPU is by Mediatek and truthfully, they make good processors. No complaints with that, but that GPU is a soar spot. There are two live wallpapers that I really like, and they would not run at all on this device. Just completely bogged down the phone. I know many people love FHD phones, but maybe this device should have had a 720pP display and not the FHD with this GPU. Otherwise excellent phone and I cannot wait to see what else Blu brings in the future. They also mentioned a 4.4 update coming by the end of Q2 2014. Worth a look.EDIT: March 3rd 2014. Friday I used it outside as a GPS. GPS satellites, and WiFI plus all the Google location permissions turned on and the phone for over 10 minutes could not pick up a precise location. After the 10 mins I just gave up. Returned the phone as Amazon did not have the white in stock per my return. Really a shame too, it is a really nice phone. Not sure if my unit was defective as per the GPS module, but I did in fact return it. Maybe later down the road when Amazon gets the white in stock, I'll pick up another one. Credit to Amazon's fantastic return policy and process.","123","helpful"

"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black","BLU","292.99","5","Just received the phone today. I've had a BLU phone before and knew I'd get a great device for an affordable price. The dual SIM feature is a bonus for me as we are considering switching from T-Mobile to Cricket because of coverage. Of course one problem with any non T-Mo phone (other than an iPhone with iOS 8) is that there is no Wi-Fi calling to fall back on. So far my T-Mo coverage actually seems better, though I haven't had a good chance to try out everywhere yet.One issue I've found is that the product description states this phone can handle a 64 GB MicroSD card so I purchased one and gave my 32 GB card to a friend after backing up my data. When I opened the shipping box, the back of the phone box says it can use up to a 32 GB card. I went ahead and copied my data to the new card, but the phone will not recognize it.As some have mentioned, data use can be an issue. I haven't studied it yet but it appears that SIM 1 is the full speed LTE slot, so you want the SIM with your best data package there. One thing to note, however, is that in my case I can only run the Cricket SIM in SIM 1. I have more data on T-Mo, but the Cricket SIM refuses to connect at all if it is in SIM 2. The T-Mo card works in either one, but it can only find 2G data when installed in SIM 2. I'm planing to visit a friend this weekend so I may try to swing by a Cricket shop and see if they have any advice.So far I would say that the pros are the screen, Dual SIM slots, included accessories, and the signal strength. Cons would include the misleading product description regarding max SD card size here (though BLU's site and the product box agree with each other about a 32 GB max) and the SIM slot idiosyncrasies and current lack of information on how to properly set them up.All in all, it's a fine device and well worth the money. Depending on your cellular provider, though, you may need to take it into a store or call customer service to get everything working properly.I haven't even had it for an entire day so I will update with more information as I can test it out better.","146","helpful"

At this price point and features, and assuming the reliability stays strong, I will NEVER change phones (well, never say never in tech :))Pro's - FAST. Loaded nova Launcher all my travel stuff, maps. Absolutely the fastest phone I've worked with, though granted I only made it up to the Note 4....but this thing smokes. - Screen. For any price point. Unbelievable. The 4k screen and clarity with G-Glass 3, simply amazing for this price point. - Fingerprint. I will never go back. Encrypted the phone, password locked it then trained 4 fingers. The position of the sensor and the speed to unlock.... absolutely wonderful - Camera - Not a big camera buff, but for casual photo's very nice for 24mp. Shouldn't rely on my inputs here as I'm mostly business focus'd - Dual Sim - ATT/T-Mobile for me (work/personal). Zero issues. Hot spot, LTE.... good across the board. I realize there is a band missing, but I can VPN into my home, watch 4gb MKV videos with no lag. No issues for me. - Good ol├⌐ fashioned service. Comes with case view flip cover. Comes with Gel Case alternative. Comes with screen protector. Comes with micro USB to full USB adapter, decent headphones and a nice high-amp charger. No one does this anymore. I was very pleasantly surprised. - Battery life. Better than my note 3, and note 4 by a factor of 2 at least and I don't even use battery saver. Considering the pixel ratio, nice.CONS - Only one I have is I can't get Lynch 2010 working for work. No button appears for server settings. (this can admittably be me and doing a bit of research, but I honestly haven't had the time to deal with it in the few days I've had the pone.Summary.I will never purchase a 400$+ phone ever again as long as a product like this stays active from a company here in the US. Considering my customers and tech available to me, I see no reason to spend more. Apple lovers, well, they have a nice product..... at twice the price. All the other phones out there in Android, well no complaints to other flagships, but I honestly couldn't tell you one advantage to go another direction.We shall see on the reliability.Satisfied customer and then some.

"BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Gold","BLU","134.95","5","SUPPLEMENTAL USER GUIDE for BLU Pure XLBLU's official User Guide for the Pure XL is rather skimpy. I have made so many additions to this review that it now qualifies as a supplemental user guide. Please feel free in the comments to add additional features I may have missed.I have two BLU Pure XL's (mine - Grey color, received 8 Nov 2015) (wife's- gold color, received 11 Dec 2015)I am very impressed with the package -- even the box it comes in is impressive, with thick walls all around.It is the kind of box one keeps, rather than discards. It all adds to the premium aura of the phone.What's inside the box is even more impressive -1) Phone -- The phone sets in a tray in the top of the box, with all the accessories underneath. This a very executive-looking phone, especially the grey color, and especially with the flip-top battery cover installed (see below.)--- Phone size & weight ΓÇô This a big phone straddling the line between a phone and a tablet. Yet for all its size, it is fairly trim and compact ΓÇô very high class and/or executive appearing ΓÇô more ΓÇ£high classΓÇ¥ in the gold color, and more ΓÇ£executiveΓÇ¥ in the grey color (in my opinion.)It is a two-handed phone for the most part, as most people will not be able to work it with just one hand ΓÇô especially if the flip-top battery cover is used. I have always been a two-handed user, even for much smaller phones, so this is not an issue for me.The phone also weighs a lot. In your shirt pocket, or in the inner pocket of jacket ΓÇô at 202 grams, you will feel it sag your clothing. In a pants pocket (if the pockets are big enough), or a travel vest, it rides easier. But for ordinary clothing it is much better suited for a holster. There is not much choice in aftermarket cases and holsters, but there is a good vertical holster on Amazon (which is what I use.)2) Accessories included are more and better than what normally comes with a phone:--- Battery cover - normal: The phones comes with the normal battery cover attached. You are going to have to take the battery cover off to insert the SIM card(s) and the microSD card, so you might as well take it off and insert those items. (You can't access the battery -- is not user replaceable)--- Flip-top Battery cover - The 2nd battery cover choice has an integrated flip-top. It is not a case that goes over the battery cover -- it is the battery cover - with a flip-top attached.I have always thought that combining a battery cover with a flip-top would be a good idea (even thought of making one once,) so it was a pleasant surprise to find out that is exactly what BLU created especially for the Pure XL. This isn't some cheap flip-top -- it is a well thought out, quality cover that deactivates the screen when closed.In addition, the flip top has a little window that activates a little screen display especially sized and positioned to show through the opening in the flip-top ΓÇô which only appears when the flip-top is closed. So this feature only works with this flip-top battery cover.I havenΓÇÖt found any way to customize what is displayed in the flip-top window, other than it displays a digital clock, and you can change the background by sliding a fingertip down the little screen. In addition, the native music player app (just labeled ΓÇ£MusicΓÇ¥) will display in the flip-top window while playing, and the native alarm clock will also display there when the alarm is sounding -- so you can tap the controls with the flip-top closed.. I initially thought maybe the edges of the flip-top would be magnetized to stick to the metal frame of the phone to stay neatly closed, since there is no clasp. But it appears that just the weight of the flip-top closes it when it is lying flat, and swings open for you just by turning it on its edge.As you probably already guessed, I opted for the flip-top -- very cool - very thin, understated, and very executive! I really like this solution. I hold the phone lightly and hook my thumb through the flip-topΓÇÖs window for a more secure hold on the phone when I am cradling it in my hand.--- Gel case - transparent - this gel case does fit over the normal battery cover and phone edges. But it will not fit completely over the flip-top battery cover (interference from small bulge on the side due to the hinge), so I don't use it,For those who use the normal battery cover, the gel case provides extra protection. And because it is transparent, you hardly notice it on the phone.--- Fast 5v/9v charger with detachable USB to micro USB data/charge cord ΓÇô This is a fast charger ΓÇô 25% in 25 minutes or less. And, according to some reports, you are going to need it. That big 6"", ultra-high resolution screen, combined with some powerful processors, can be battery hogs ΓÇô especially if you turn on all the cool features.Note that this is a 2 amp charger, and the charger cord is also designed for 2 amps. Don't use a smaller charge cord on it.I normally keep my cell phones on a charger, every chance I get, and leave it on the charger when I am stationary at my desk. However, I deliberately left the phone off the charger all day and night, just to see how fast it would deplete under my normal use -- and it got down to 25%, which isnΓÇÖt bad for a phone this powerful.The one thing that is not included is an automobile fast charger version - for when you are traveling by auto. But if you can find a 5v, 2 amp auto charger, will work -- just not as fast.--- Screen protector - for those that want one, it is included, with a cleaning cloth. I don't use them (I can never get all the air bubbles out.) I think with the flip-top battery cover, another screen protector is not needed.--- Ear buds headset with phone/music button, and mic and volume control -- The ear buds fit in your ear canal. They provide a much better sound then do the type that fit outside your ear canal. The phone/music button allows you to switch between a phone call and your music. The mic allows you talk with the headset on. And, of course, the volume control allows you to raise or lower the volume. This is a high quality headset, and comes with two extra ear-bud gels (smaller and larger) to custom fit to your ear canal.--- OTG adapter - ""OTG"" stands for ΓÇ£On The Go.ΓÇ¥ It looks like a very short USB to microUSB cable. But it is wired to allow you to attach devices you otherwise couldn't, such as a USB flash drive, or a USB SD card adapter, both of which are a much faster way to transfer files than Bluetooth. If you don't have a USB flash drive, or a USB-SD adapter, get one -- they are only a few bucks on Amazon or eBay, and are very handy with OTG capability.--- Instructions - a very basic small-print user manual is included, as well as a small SIM card installation guide. BLU has included a Help app on the phone, which has a link to download a digital version to your phone. You can also get the digital version on-line at [...] The digital version is much easier to read on the phoneΓÇÖs screen than trying to read the physical printed one.PHONE FEATURES For the well-ilustrated features in BLU Sales Info (downloadable), go here: phone [...]--- PROCESSORs- - - - Mediatek Heliox10 MT6795 OctaCore @ 2MHz- - - - PowerVR G6200 GPU- - - - RAM 3GBTrendemous computer power in the above three, well-matched components of central processor, graphics processor, and on-board memory. This machine is very fast, with no noticeable lag in any operations, from fingerprint recognition, scrolling thru menus or lists, or playing 3D games. It is awesome by itself, and when you consider the price, it is astounding.--- Screen ΓÇô The first thing one sees is the large 6ΓÇ¥ screen made of Gorilla 3 glass. But what makes it a premium screen is the quad HD resolution of 2560 x 1440 (490 pixels per inch). Only the really high-end phones and tablets have that kind of resolution. The super amoled screen is just that ΓÇô super. You can easily run full web pages on this screen without having to zoom and pan. The smallest details are really sharp and clear. Even with a magnifying glass you can barely discern there are pixels. The colors are vivid and you can adjust the color scheme from warm (slight red cast), to normal to cool (slight blue cast).--- The 'Pure' in Pure XL ΓÇô The ΓÇ£pureΓÇ¥ might stand for ΓÇ£pure Android,ΓÇ¥ because there doesnΓÇÖt appear to be much of an added ΓÇ£skin.ΓÇ¥ But that might just mean it is well integrated into the OS. You will have to add any wanted functionality yourself that is not pre-installed, such as an app drawer (typical of Lollipop not to have one). But that is good if you want to customize the hell out of YOUR phone, without leaving a trail of manufacturerΓÇÖs bloat of useless (to you) features, apps and widgets you canΓÇÖt delete.--- User Interface (UI) ΓÇô The native launcher is a skin called Carefree. Personally, I canΓÇÖt tell what in the UI is native Lollipop, or BLUΓÇÖs overlay. In either case it isnΓÇÖt customizable enough for me, and I donΓÇÖt particularly like the native themes, lack of an app tray, and limited options available.So I installed Nova Launcher (free) and Nova Launcher Premium ($5) ΓÇô you will need both to unlock all the options -- which restores the app tray and allows me much, much greater flexibility in customizing ΓÇô such as adding an app tray, resizing the app icons, decreasing the space between icons, increasing how many icons will fit on a screen, different shapes for folders than icons, etc., etc.. Also the Nova LauncherΓÇÖs quick access app tray (at the bottom of the screen) allows more than just four apps, which are in addition to the app trayΓÇÖs launch button.If you donΓÇÖt have an alternate launcher, get one.--- OS ΓÇô The Android 5.1 (Lollipop) operating system (OS) is sufficiently different from Android 4.4 (KitKat) that a small learning curve on your part will be suffered while you learn some new navigation methods. But generally it is mostly intuitive, and quickly learned. If you are coming from an even earlier OS, then the learning curve may be steeper. While I heard a lot of bad things about Lollipop, I, for one, like it.- - - - - Notifications and Settings -- The Notifications bar pulls down from the top of the screen separately from the Settings Shortcuts, which pull up from the bottom of the screen. For more setting shortcuts (hidden), tap the ... at the bottom right of the Settings bar. Not all settings are collected here, nor in the settings list,- - - - - Phone Settings -- There are additional settings under Phone which are not duplicated elsewhere (such as ""noise reduction"").PHONE (tap the phone icon on the bottom tray) > ... More (bottom right of call screen) > Settings > Call Settings > Advanced Settings- - - - - Screen capture -- Normal full-screen capture is by simultaneously pressing volume down and the on/off buttons on the side bezel. Or a partial screen can also be captured using the Customize Screen Capture function in the Settings bar (it's icon is an S inside a box) -- A box appears on screen which can be resized by dragging any corner.- - - - - Home Screen Edit function:- - - - - - 1) On any home screen, squeeze two fingertips together to get to the Edit Home Screens display.- - - - - - 2) You will see all the home screens in miniature, which you can drag to rearrange their order.- - - - - - 3) To set the main Home Screen tap the little house on top the home screen you want to be the main.- - - - - - 4) Below the Home screens you will see three Icons:- - - - - - - - - Wallpapers . . . Widgets . . . Settings.- - - - - - - - -Wallpapers- - - - - - 5) Tap the wallpaper icon to bring up the Wallpaper select function.- - - - - - 6) You can pick any graphic or photo for a wallpaper- - - - - - - - -Widgets (this is the only way to access widgets)- - - - - - 5) Tap on the Widgets icon to bring up the widgets list- - - - - - 6) Tap and hold the desired widget and drag it to the home screen and position you want, then release it.- - - - - - - - Contacts (Placed on the Home Screen using the Contacts widget)- - - - - - 5) Tap on the Widgets icon to bring up the widgets list- - - - - - 6) Tap and hold the Contacts widget and drag it to the home screen and position you want, then release it.- - - - - - 7) The contacts menu will automatically open ΓÇô tap the contact you want to display. The contact icon will display on the home screen.- - - - - - - - Settings- - - - - - 5) This brings up the settings menu for your default User Interface Launcher. That would be the Carefree launcher for stock, or the launcher you installed (if you installed one, and made it the default.)--- Internal Memory ΓÇô the phone comes with 64GB of internal memory, which is an enormous amount. I canΓÇÖt see anyone with a legitimate gripe on internal memory, especially at the phoneΓÇÖs price point.--- microSD card ΓÇô I installed a 64GB microSDXC card. I had put some files on it before I inserted it into the phone, but the OS did not (or refused to) see the files and wanted to format the microSD card ΓÇô so I let it format the card. After the format, I had no problems with it.So donΓÇÖt bother putting any files on it before installing it, as the phone may refuse to acknowledge their existence. Lollipop seems to be particular on how files are put on the microSD ΓÇô seems like it wants to process them through its OS. The only things Lollipop wants to allow on the microSD is data, pictures and music. Some users have reported moving some apps to external storage (microSD card), and some have reported problems with that. But with 64GB of internal memory, there should not be a need to move apps to external storage on this phone.--- Camera ΓÇô The rear-facing camera is 24MB, and the front-facing camera is wide angle 8MB. Lots of native settings to ease your photo taking workload. Automatic is not necessarily your best setting, so you will want to experiment a little. You have separate settings for front and rear cameras, and also separately for Photo and Video.- - - - Front Camera -- I have taken a few selfies with the front camera, and they come out really good ΓÇô great even, showing all your warts and wrinkles in sharp detail. Resolution and aspect ratio choices are as follow:PHOTOS . . . . . VIDEO8MP (4:3) . . . . 720p high6MP (16:9) . . . 480p medium2MP {4:3) . . . . QCP lowVGA (4:3)- - - - Rear Camera -- Video at full resolution can run up some huge files -- easily 100MB or more. The picture quality is very good, depending on the resolution you choose.The resolutions (picture sizes), are as follows: PHOTOS . . . . . VIDEO24MP (4:3) . . . . . . . 4k - superfine (for display on an ultraHD screen)18MP (16:9) . . . . 1080p - fine (for display on a 1080 HD screen)12MP (16:9) . . . . . 720p - high (for display on a 720 HD screen)8MP (16:9) . . . . . . 480p - medium (for display on a low resolution screen)5MP (16:9) . . . . . . QCIF - low (for display on a very low resolution screen)--- Magnetometer / Compass ΓÇô BLU does not list it, but there is a magnetometer, and I believe a pre-installed a compass app is on the phone (at least I donΓÇÖt remember installing it.) But if there isnΓÇÖt a compass app pre-installed, then install one ΓÇô it will work. NOTE: Magnets around or close to the phone can screw up the magnetometer, so if the compass function is important to you, donΓÇÖt use case covers with magnetic clasps or use magnetic phone holders.--- Music Player (native) ΓÇô The native music player has a neat feature that, when the flip-top battery cover is used, the player will re-size itself to fit in the little window in the flip-top (that feature doesnΓÇÖt work for other music player apps, though it likely is a Lollipop feature they could make use of.) The native music player also has an Equalizer, color themes, HiFi or DTS options, and settings for different types of earphones or speakers, including Bluetooth. (DTS stands for Digital Theater Systems, if you want to pursue further info on it)--- FM Radio ΓÇô There is no FM radio ne in this US version. So if you want FM music, youΓÇÖll have to install a streaming app to pull it off the internet.--- Sound ΓÇô The sound through the rear-mounted stereo speakers on this phone is simply amazing ΓÇô loud, clear, deep, and distortion-free throughout its frequency range. It is by far the best sound I have ever heard on a small device. Some reviewers have lambasted the fact that such powerful speakers are rear mounted. But you could just turn them to face you, or, better yet, set the back an inch or so from a hard surface to reflect the sound and also get a little ΓÇ£reverb.ΓÇ¥ If you lay the phone down flat on a table or desk, the sound will attenuate a little ΓÇô just raise it off the surface and inch or so to get the full effect of the reflected sound. Do that in a tiled bathroom, and it really gets in the reverb.And if you want my secret music reverb chamber plan -- well it is just an empty 32 oz. tub of yogurt -- eat the yogurt, wash out the container, dry it, set it on your desk or table, start the music, and set the phone in the tub -- voil├á, deeper, richer music.--- Fingerprint Scanner ΓÇô very conveniently located on the back of the phone underneath the camera. Setting it up, it wants to take several readings of your fingertip before that finger is accepted. It is pretty quick, and my preferred method of security. You can store up to five fingers. You can choose which fingers you use, such as your middle finger(s) instead of your index finger, which will make it even harder to break into.--- NFC ΓÇô NFC stands for Near Field Connection. ΓÇ£NearΓÇ¥ means touching another NFC device, or an NFC sticker, or within an inch of it. It is the new connectivity ΓÇ£thing,ΓÇ¥ though the technology is not new. If your old phone had NFC, you could put the new phone and old phone back to back, and all your personal data would transfer to the new phone. I tried this with my Pure XL and my wife's new Pure XL, and as soon as I put them back to back, I got a beddle-beedle-boop, and near everything personal was transferred -- very fast.Unfortunately, none of my other devices have NFC, but it is something you definitely want to migrate to eventually. If you were with a business contact or client who had NFC on their device, you could exchange business cards by merely touching phones together (assuming you programed a business card into the NFC sticker affixed to the inside of the battery case.) You can also program NFC stickers, which you can place wherever you want, which, when touched by the phone, causes some pre-programmed action or activity on your phone (such as turn on/off an alarm, or activate airplane mode, or shut the phone off, or wake it up.)--- WLAN Direct -- This is the Pure XL equivalent implementation of WiFi Direct (also called WiDi). You access the control through the settings menu [SETTINGS > Wireless & Networks > ...More > WLAN Direct > (click on Peer Devices to find compatible devices in range)]. Once you find a compatible device, and pair with it, you can save it to Remembered Groups. I managed to pair to my Galaxy Tab Pro, Tab S2, and my PC, but couldn't transfer a file until I installed Super Beam Pro in all machines. Once SuperBeam was installed, the transfer process was easy, and very quick.--- Bluetooth -- v4.0, A2DP, EDR -- If you are transferring from another device with Bluetooth v4, transfer is extremely fast; from/to Bluetooth v3, pretty fast; and from/to Bluetooth v2, pretty slow. I transferred 100 songs at a time and from my Galaxy Tab Pro (Bluetooth v4.0) and it only took a few minutes for each 100 song set.--- Blacklists -- Both the native text app and the native phone app have a Blacklist option. Set a number in the Blacklist, and your phone will not ring or answer. Not sure exactly what it does SMS, as I have not tested it yet.--- Lockscreen -- You won't find a lock screen setting. Lollipop did away with a separate lock screen image. Whatever image you pick for a Wallpaper will also display on the lock screen. And you can't put widgets on the lock screen, at least directly. There are some apps that can be used to alter the lockscreen however, all the ones I tried either disable the fingerprint sensor, or you get a double lock. There are also some apps to put widgets on the lockscreen by simulating them as a persistent notification.--- Daydream -- Daydream is not new to Android, having been enabled in KitKat. It is a completely useless feature that only works while your phone is charging. You access it through Settings > Display > Daydream. The stock Daydream engine is a slide show, which allows you to choose the folder, but not individual images within the folder. The stock engine will not run animated GIFs. There are apps that allow more options, including animated GIFS. I use GIF Player HD, which will install itself as a Daydream engine option, and also the default animated GIF player in File Explorer.--- Cast Screen -- The BLU Pure XL has native support for wireless screencasting. But there is no support for wired screencasting (the microUSB port is not MHL compliant.) To use the native wireless screencasting, you enable it through the Settings [Settings > Display > Cast Screen]. There are several ways to effect wireless screencasting. You have to have a target screen identified to cast to -- one that has chromecast or miracast built-in, or, for casting to a PC, an app that can grab the wireless signal, or, for non-Miracast compliant device, an HDMI dongle that is Miracast compliant.- - - - MIRACAST RECEIVER BUILT-IN -- If you are casting to a device that is already chromecast or Miracast compliant, you are (should be) home free.- - - - REFLECTOR 2 -- This is a screencast receiver software that installs on a PC that is not Chromecast or Miracast compliant. It works by processing the wireless signal broadcast by the Pure XL. It follows, of course, that your PC must have wireless capability activated, either internally, or on a wireless network. There are no dongles required for this solution, but the software costs $7. I have cast from the Pure XL to Reflector without any problems.- - - - DONGLES -- ChromeCast and MiraCast compliant dongles exist to provide non-compliant devices with receiver capability. They plug into an HDMI-in port on your receiving device (normally a TV.) - - - - CAST SCREEN QUALITY -- You are very likely to be disappointed with the quality of the cast picture. But this is not the fault of the phone. You will be casting from a 1440x2560 2K screen image to at most a 1080x1920 screen image, with a loss of 50% of the original pixels. While most screen casting software allows you to enlarge the image, that just makes the quality worse. This is just the state of the arts in screen casting technology. What is needed is the ability to cast a 2K or higher image. Maybe next year.HOT SPOT / TETHERINGThe BLU Pure XL can serve as a Hot Spot by tethering other devices to it for access to the internet. You set this up through settings: [Settings >> ""... more"" >> Tethering Or Portable Hotspots >> (then you have choices of Bluetooth tethering or WiFi tethering)].I tether my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7"" to the BLU Pure XL by WiFi because the Tab S2 is WiFi only, and I need the Pure XL's 4G LTE data link to use the GPS Tracking console when I am not near a WiFi source. Yes, I can also do GPS tracking on the Pure XL, but the Tab S2 gives me much wider view at the same map scale. Tethering works seamlessly -- very handy for giving 4G LTE Data capability to WiFi only device.BATTERYThe battery is a 3500 mAh, semi-permanent type, not intended to be user serviceable. It has a fast-charge circuitry that uses a 9 volt battery charge system that can recharge the battery completely in less than two hours. Every ten minutes on the charger provides an additional 10% recharge. While the back cover is removable, that is only to allow access to the two SIM card slots and the separate microSD slot.BATTERY LIFEBattery Life is very much a user variable as well as a function of the processor size and speed, screen size and resolution, and battery size. No phone with this much processing power, screen size, and resolution is going to have battery life comparable to a low performance, low resolution phone. It takes a high battery drain to run all that power. That is just a fact of life ΓÇô all the super phones (and this is a super phone) are going to have this problem ΓÇô and the only way around it is for the user is to manage battery consumption, or choose a lower performance phone.Battery size is also a design tradeoff between capacity and weight ΓÇô the higher the capacity, the higher the weight. At 3500 mAh, the battery is already big, and heavy. Making it any bigger is going to increase the weight of the phone, which in turn could adversely affect sales.Complaints of poor battery life on this phone is comparable to a VW buyer buying a Hummer, and complaining because the Hummer only gets 10 mpg instead of the 40 mpg they got in their tiny bug. It just isnΓÇÖt a rational comparison.All that said, you can significantly increase battery life by adopting these user-controlled functions and procedures:1) The highest battery drain is the screen. Adopting a dark wallpaper, or even better, an all-black wallpaper, very significantly decreases battery drain. And that has the added benefit that your screen items will be more visible ΓÇô actually pop out at you, which allows you to turn down screen brightness even more.2) The higher the screen brightness, the higher the battery drain. Turn down the screen brightness to just above what you need to read it.3) The next biggest battery drain is the octa-core CPU. Yes, it so fast that you can run all the apps simultaneously without a lag, and impress your friends. But running it fill bore by having every app open and running is comparable to running your car with the ΓÇ£pedal to the metalΓÇ¥ full throttle -- it is going to greatly increase your fuel drain and drastically decrease your mileage.Turn off features you are not actually using. Use the NFC stickers to turn on necessary features that are location dependent ΓÇô such as Bluetooth for your hands-free system in your vehicle. Back completely out of apps you are finished with so they are not running in the background.One day, scientists and engineers will bring us a tiny battery that can run our whole house for years ΓÇô but that isnΓÇÖt here yet. Until then, youΓÇÖll have to manage your battery yourself.NATIVE APPSFlashlight/Torch ΓÇô The native flashlight app is called ΓÇ£Torch,ΓÇ¥ and it is a Lollipop feature (IΓÇÖm told). It uses the camera flash LEDs as a light source. It will also flash on and off SOS style.Flappy Android: (Lollipop's equivalent of Floppy Bird.) This is a ΓÇ£secretΓÇ¥ game put in by the Lollipop development team. To access it, go to:[Settings > About Device > Android Version >(tap on ΓÇ£Android VersionΓÇ¥ four times quickly) > (An ΓÇ£Easter EggΓÇ¥ appears) >(tap on the Easter egg and it turns into a Lollipop) >(tap on the lollipop and it changes color) >(long-press the lollipop and it activates the Flappy Android game) >(To activate the Flappy Android, tap the screen each time)]MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, & PARTSBLU has maintenance and repair facilities in the US, supposedly stocked with parts. However, in general, BLU does not sell parts to individuals or unapproved repair shops. So if you are having problems with your phone, resign yourself to service by BLU, contact them and make arrangements to send your phone in for repairs. (www bluproducts com)*Within the warranty period ΓÇô You should make a warranty claim on any malfunction that occurs within the warranty period. However, donΓÇÖt expect that everything that goes wrong will be approved for free warranty service. The following items will generally be ruled to be user abuse, and not be covered by warranty ΓÇô- - evidence of being dropped (broken or cracked screen)- - evidence of force (broken or loose microUSB port)- - evidence of water damage (clouded and/or pixilated screen), and- - evidence of tampering (broken seals, missing screws, pry marks, etc.)Outside the warranty period, or warranty claim denied, BLU will still make repairs. But will likely require payment first.There are alternate sources for parts. The Gionee Elife E8 is an exact clone, and almost all parts are interchangeable with the BLU Pure XL. However, most part sources for the Gionee are in India.[...][...]*Extra chargers and cords ΓÇô If you want an extra charger and cord (one for home and one for the office), there are usually some used ones available on eBay for about $10.[...]** replace the interior spaces with a ΓÇ£.ΓÇ¥ to make the link workWARRANTYBLU Products, Inc.

"BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Grey","BLU","129.99","5","SUPPLEMENTAL USER GUIDE for BLU Pure XLBLU's official User Guide for the Pure XL is rather skimpy. I have made so many additions to this review that it now qualifies as a supplemental user guide. Please feel free in the comments to add additional features I may have missed.I have two BLU Pure XL's (mine - Grey color, received 8 Nov 2015) (wife's- gold color, received 11 Dec 2015)I am very impressed with the package -- even the box it comes in is impressive, with thick walls all around.It is the kind of box one keeps, rather than discards. It all adds to the premium aura of the phone.What's inside the box is even more impressive -1) Phone -- The phone sets in a tray in the top of the box, with all the accessories underneath. This a very executive-looking phone, especially the grey color, and especially with the flip-top battery cover installed (see below.)--- Phone size & weight ΓÇô This a big phone straddling the line between a phone and a tablet. Yet for all its size, it is fairly trim and compact ΓÇô very high class and/or executive appearing ΓÇô more ΓÇ£high classΓÇ¥ in the gold color, and more ΓÇ£executiveΓÇ¥ in the grey color (in my opinion.)It is a two-handed phone for the most part, as most people will not be able to work it with just one hand ΓÇô especially if the flip-top battery cover is used. I have always been a two-handed user, even for much smaller phones, so this is not an issue for me.The phone also weighs a lot. In your shirt pocket, or in the inner pocket of jacket ΓÇô at 202 grams, you will feel it sag your clothing. In a pants pocket (if the pockets are big enough), or a travel vest, it rides easier. But for ordinary clothing it is much better suited for a holster. There is not much choice in aftermarket cases and holsters, but there is a good vertical holster on Amazon (which is what I use.)2) Accessories included are more and better than what normally comes with a phone:--- Battery cover - normal: The phones comes with the normal battery cover attached. You are going to have to take the battery cover off to insert the SIM card(s) and the microSD card, so you might as well take it off and insert those items. (You can't access the battery -- is not user replaceable)--- Flip-top Battery cover - The 2nd battery cover choice has an integrated flip-top. It is not a case that goes over the battery cover -- it is the battery cover - with a flip-top attached.I have always thought that combining a battery cover with a flip-top would be a good idea (even thought of making one once,) so it was a pleasant surprise to find out that is exactly what BLU created especially for the Pure XL. This isn't some cheap flip-top -- it is a well thought out, quality cover that deactivates the screen when closed.In addition, the flip top has a little window that activates a little screen display especially sized and positioned to show through the opening in the flip-top ΓÇô which only appears when the flip-top is closed. So this feature only works with this flip-top battery cover.I havenΓÇÖt found any way to customize what is displayed in the flip-top window, other than it displays a digital clock, and you can change the background by sliding a fingertip down the little screen. In addition, the native music player app (just labeled ΓÇ£MusicΓÇ¥) will display in the flip-top window while playing, and the native alarm clock will also display there when the alarm is sounding -- so you can tap the controls with the flip-top closed.. I initially thought maybe the edges of the flip-top would be magnetized to stick to the metal frame of the phone to stay neatly closed, since there is no clasp. But it appears that just the weight of the flip-top closes it when it is lying flat, and swings open for you just by turning it on its edge.As you probably already guessed, I opted for the flip-top -- very cool - very thin, understated, and very executive! I really like this solution. I hold the phone lightly and hook my thumb through the flip-topΓÇÖs window for a more secure hold on the phone when I am cradling it in my hand.--- Gel case - transparent - this gel case does fit over the normal battery cover and phone edges. But it will not fit completely over the flip-top battery cover (interference from small bulge on the side due to the hinge), so I don't use it,For those who use the normal battery cover, the gel case provides extra protection. And because it is transparent, you hardly notice it on the phone.--- Fast 5v/9v charger with detachable USB to micro USB data/charge cord ΓÇô This is a fast charger ΓÇô 25% in 25 minutes or less. And, according to some reports, you are going to need it. That big 6"", ultra-high resolution screen, combined with some powerful processors, can be battery hogs ΓÇô especially if you turn on all the cool features.Note that this is a 2 amp charger, and the charger cord is also designed for 2 amps. Don't use a smaller charge cord on it.I normally keep my cell phones on a charger, every chance I get, and leave it on the charger when I am stationary at my desk. However, I deliberately left the phone off the charger all day and night, just to see how fast it would deplete under my normal use -- and it got down to 25%, which isnΓÇÖt bad for a phone this powerful.The one thing that is not included is an automobile fast charger version - for when you are traveling by auto. But if you can find a 5v, 2 amp auto charger, will work -- just not as fast.--- Screen protector - for those that want one, it is included, with a cleaning cloth. I don't use them (I can never get all the air bubbles out.) I think with the flip-top battery cover, another screen protector is not needed.--- Ear buds headset with phone/music button, and mic and volume control -- The ear buds fit in your ear canal. They provide a much better sound then do the type that fit outside your ear canal. The phone/music button allows you to switch between a phone call and your music. The mic allows you talk with the headset on. And, of course, the volume control allows you to raise or lower the volume. This is a high quality headset, and comes with two extra ear-bud gels (smaller and larger) to custom fit to your ear canal.--- OTG adapter - ""OTG"" stands for ΓÇ£On The Go.ΓÇ¥ It looks like a very short USB to microUSB cable. But it is wired to allow you to attach devices you otherwise couldn't, such as a USB flash drive, or a USB SD card adapter, both of which are a much faster way to transfer files than Bluetooth. If you don't have a USB flash drive, or a USB-SD adapter, get one -- they are only a few bucks on Amazon or eBay, and are very handy with OTG capability.--- Instructions - a very basic small-print user manual is included, as well as a small SIM card installation guide. BLU has included a Help app on the phone, which has a link to download a digital version to your phone. You can also get the digital version on-line at [...] The digital version is much easier to read on the phoneΓÇÖs screen than trying to read the physical printed one.PHONE FEATURES For the well-ilustrated features in BLU Sales Info (downloadable), go here: phone [...]--- PROCESSORs- - - - Mediatek Heliox10 MT6795 OctaCore @ 2MHz- - - - PowerVR G6200 GPU- - - - RAM 3GBTrendemous computer power in the above three, well-matched components of central processor, graphics processor, and on-board memory. This machine is very fast, with no noticeable lag in any operations, from fingerprint recognition, scrolling thru menus or lists, or playing 3D games. It is awesome by itself, and when you consider the price, it is astounding.--- Screen ΓÇô The first thing one sees is the large 6ΓÇ¥ screen made of Gorilla 3 glass. But what makes it a premium screen is the quad HD resolution of 2560 x 1440 (490 pixels per inch). Only the really high-end phones and tablets have that kind of resolution. The super amoled screen is just that ΓÇô super. You can easily run full web pages on this screen without having to zoom and pan. The smallest details are really sharp and clear. Even with a magnifying glass you can barely discern there are pixels. The colors are vivid and you can adjust the color scheme from warm (slight red cast), to normal to cool (slight blue cast).--- The 'Pure' in Pure XL ΓÇô The ΓÇ£pureΓÇ¥ might stand for ΓÇ£pure Android,ΓÇ¥ because there doesnΓÇÖt appear to be much of an added ΓÇ£skin.ΓÇ¥ But that might just mean it is well integrated into the OS. You will have to add any wanted functionality yourself that is not pre-installed, such as an app drawer (typical of Lollipop not to have one). But that is good if you want to customize the hell out of YOUR phone, without leaving a trail of manufacturerΓÇÖs bloat of useless (to you) features, apps and widgets you canΓÇÖt delete.--- User Interface (UI) ΓÇô The native launcher is a skin called Carefree. Personally, I canΓÇÖt tell what in the UI is native Lollipop, or BLUΓÇÖs overlay. In either case it isnΓÇÖt customizable enough for me, and I donΓÇÖt particularly like the native themes, lack of an app tray, and limited options available.So I installed Nova Launcher (free) and Nova Launcher Premium ($5) ΓÇô you will need both to unlock all the options -- which restores the app tray and allows me much, much greater flexibility in customizing ΓÇô such as adding an app tray, resizing the app icons, decreasing the space between icons, increasing how many icons will fit on a screen, different shapes for folders than icons, etc., etc.. Also the Nova LauncherΓÇÖs quick access app tray (at the bottom of the screen) allows more than just four apps, which are in addition to the app trayΓÇÖs launch button.If you donΓÇÖt have an alternate launcher, get one.--- OS ΓÇô The Android 5.1 (Lollipop) operating system (OS) is sufficiently different from Android 4.4 (KitKat) that a small learning curve on your part will be suffered while you learn some new navigation methods. But generally it is mostly intuitive, and quickly learned. If you are coming from an even earlier OS, then the learning curve may be steeper. While I heard a lot of bad things about Lollipop, I, for one, like it.- - - - - Notifications and Settings -- The Notifications bar pulls down from the top of the screen separately from the Settings Shortcuts, which pull up from the bottom of the screen. For more setting shortcuts (hidden), tap the ... at the bottom right of the Settings bar. Not all settings are collected here, nor in the settings list,- - - - - Phone Settings -- There are additional settings under Phone which are not duplicated elsewhere (such as ""noise reduction"").PHONE (tap the phone icon on the bottom tray) > ... More (bottom right of call screen) > Settings > Call Settings > Advanced Settings- - - - - Screen capture -- Normal full-screen capture is by simultaneously pressing volume down and the on/off buttons on the side bezel. Or a partial screen can also be captured using the Customize Screen Capture function in the Settings bar (it's icon is an S inside a box) -- A box appears on screen which can be resized by dragging any corner.- - - - - Home Screen Edit function:- - - - - - 1) On any home screen, squeeze two fingertips together to get to the Edit Home Screens display.- - - - - - 2) You will see all the home screens in miniature, which you can drag to rearrange their order.- - - - - - 3) To set the main Home Screen tap the little house on top the home screen you want to be the main.- - - - - - 4) Below the Home screens you will see three Icons:- - - - - - - - - Wallpapers . . . Widgets . . . Settings.- - - - - - - - -Wallpapers- - - - - - 5) Tap the wallpaper icon to bring up the Wallpaper select function.- - - - - - 6) You can pick any graphic or photo for a wallpaper- - - - - - - - -Widgets (this is the only way to access widgets)- - - - - - 5) Tap on the Widgets icon to bring up the widgets list- - - - - - 6) Tap and hold the desired widget and drag it to the home screen and position you want, then release it.- - - - - - - - Contacts (Placed on the Home Screen using the Contacts widget)- - - - - - 5) Tap on the Widgets icon to bring up the widgets list- - - - - - 6) Tap and hold the Contacts widget and drag it to the home screen and position you want, then release it.- - - - - - 7) The contacts menu will automatically open ΓÇô tap the contact you want to display. The contact icon will display on the home screen.- - - - - - - - Settings- - - - - - 5) This brings up the settings menu for your default User Interface Launcher. That would be the Carefree launcher for stock, or the launcher you installed (if you installed one, and made it the default.)--- Internal Memory ΓÇô the phone comes with 64GB of internal memory, which is an enormous amount. I canΓÇÖt see anyone with a legitimate gripe on internal memory, especially at the phoneΓÇÖs price point.--- microSD card ΓÇô I installed a 64GB microSDXC card. I had put some files on it before I inserted it into the phone, but the OS did not (or refused to) see the files and wanted to format the microSD card ΓÇô so I let it format the card. After the format, I had no problems with it.So donΓÇÖt bother putting any files on it before installing it, as the phone may refuse to acknowledge their existence. Lollipop seems to be particular on how files are put on the microSD ΓÇô seems like it wants to process them through its OS. The only things Lollipop wants to allow on the microSD is data, pictures and music. Some users have reported moving some apps to external storage (microSD card), and some have reported problems with that. But with 64GB of internal memory, there should not be a need to move apps to external storage on this phone.--- Camera ΓÇô The rear-facing camera is 24MB, and the front-facing camera is wide angle 8MB. Lots of native settings to ease your photo taking workload. Automatic is not necessarily your best setting, so you will want to experiment a little. You have separate settings for front and rear cameras, and also separately for Photo and Video.- - - - Front Camera -- I have taken a few selfies with the front camera, and they come out really good ΓÇô great even, showing all your warts and wrinkles in sharp detail. Resolution and aspect ratio choices are as follow:PHOTOS . . . . . VIDEO8MP (4:3) . . . . 720p high6MP (16:9) . . . 480p medium2MP {4:3) . . . . QCP lowVGA (4:3)- - - - Rear Camera -- Video at full resolution can run up some huge files -- easily 100MB or more. The picture quality is very good, depending on the resolution you choose.The resolutions (picture sizes), are as follows: PHOTOS . . . . . VIDEO24MP (4:3) . . . . . . . 4k - superfine (for display on an ultraHD screen)18MP (16:9) . . . . 1080p - fine (for display on a 1080 HD screen)12MP (16:9) . . . . . 720p - high (for display on a 720 HD screen)8MP (16:9) . . . . . . 480p - medium (for display on a low resolution screen)5MP (16:9) . . . . . . QCIF - low (for display on a very low resolution screen)--- Magnetometer / Compass ΓÇô BLU does not list it, but there is a magnetometer, and I believe a pre-installed a compass app is on the phone (at least I donΓÇÖt remember installing it.) But if there isnΓÇÖt a compass app pre-installed, then install one ΓÇô it will work. NOTE: Magnets around or close to the phone can screw up the magnetometer, so if the compass function is important to you, donΓÇÖt use case covers with magnetic clasps or use magnetic phone holders.--- Music Player (native) ΓÇô The native music player has a neat feature that, when the flip-top battery cover is used, the player will re-size itself to fit in the little window in the flip-top (that feature doesnΓÇÖt work for other music player apps, though it likely is a Lollipop feature they could make use of.) The native music player also has an Equalizer, color themes, HiFi or DTS options, and settings for different types of earphones or speakers, including Bluetooth. (DTS stands for Digital Theater Systems, if you want to pursue further info on it)--- FM Radio ΓÇô There is no FM radio ne in this US version. So if you want FM music, youΓÇÖll have to install a streaming app to pull it off the internet.--- Sound ΓÇô The sound through the rear-mounted stereo speakers on this phone is simply amazing ΓÇô loud, clear, deep, and distortion-free throughout its frequency range. It is by far the best sound I have ever heard on a small device. Some reviewers have lambasted the fact that such powerful speakers are rear mounted. But you could just turn them to face you, or, better yet, set the back an inch or so from a hard surface to reflect the sound and also get a little ΓÇ£reverb.ΓÇ¥ If you lay the phone down flat on a table or desk, the sound will attenuate a little ΓÇô just raise it off the surface and inch or so to get the full effect of the reflected sound. Do that in a tiled bathroom, and it really gets in the reverb.And if you want my secret music reverb chamber plan -- well it is just an empty 32 oz. tub of yogurt -- eat the yogurt, wash out the container, dry it, set it on your desk or table, start the music, and set the phone in the tub -- voil├á, deeper, richer music.--- Fingerprint Scanner ΓÇô very conveniently located on the back of the phone underneath the camera. Setting it up, it wants to take several readings of your fingertip before that finger is accepted. It is pretty quick, and my preferred method of security. You can store up to five fingers. You can choose which fingers you use, such as your middle finger(s) instead of your index finger, which will make it even harder to break into.--- NFC ΓÇô NFC stands for Near Field Connection. ΓÇ£NearΓÇ¥ means touching another NFC device, or an NFC sticker, or within an inch of it. It is the new connectivity ΓÇ£thing,ΓÇ¥ though the technology is not new. If your old phone had NFC, you could put the new phone and old phone back to back, and all your personal data would transfer to the new phone. I tried this with my Pure XL and my wife's new Pure XL, and as soon as I put them back to back, I got a beddle-beedle-boop, and near everything personal was transferred -- very fast.Unfortunately, none of my other devices have NFC, but it is something you definitely want to migrate to eventually. If you were with a business contact or client who had NFC on their device, you could exchange business cards by merely touching phones together (assuming you programed a business card into the NFC sticker affixed to the inside of the battery case.) You can also program NFC stickers, which you can place wherever you want, which, when touched by the phone, causes some pre-programmed action or activity on your phone (such as turn on/off an alarm, or activate airplane mode, or shut the phone off, or wake it up.)--- WLAN Direct -- This is the Pure XL equivalent implementation of WiFi Direct (also called WiDi). You access the control through the settings menu [SETTINGS > Wireless & Networks > ...More > WLAN Direct > (click on Peer Devices to find compatible devices in range)]. Once you find a compatible device, and pair with it, you can save it to Remembered Groups. I managed to pair to my Galaxy Tab Pro, Tab S2, and my PC, but couldn't transfer a file until I installed Super Beam Pro in all machines. Once SuperBeam was installed, the transfer process was easy, and very quick.--- Bluetooth -- v4.0, A2DP, EDR -- If you are transferring from another device with Bluetooth v4, transfer is extremely fast; from/to Bluetooth v3, pretty fast; and from/to Bluetooth v2, pretty slow. I transferred 100 songs at a time and from my Galaxy Tab Pro (Bluetooth v4.0) and it only took a few minutes for each 100 song set.--- Blacklists -- Both the native text app and the native phone app have a Blacklist option. Set a number in the Blacklist, and your phone will not ring or answer. Not sure exactly what it does SMS, as I have not tested it yet.--- Lockscreen -- You won't find a lock screen setting. Lollipop did away with a separate lock screen image. Whatever image you pick for a Wallpaper will also display on the lock screen. And you can't put widgets on the lock screen, at least directly. There are some apps that can be used to alter the lockscreen however, all the ones I tried either disable the fingerprint sensor, or you get a double lock. There are also some apps to put widgets on the lockscreen by simulating them as a persistent notification.--- Daydream -- Daydream is not new to Android, having been enabled in KitKat. It is a completely useless feature that only works while your phone is charging. You access it through Settings > Display > Daydream. The stock Daydream engine is a slide show, which allows you to choose the folder, but not individual images within the folder. The stock engine will not run animated GIFs. There are apps that allow more options, including animated GIFS. I use GIF Player HD, which will install itself as a Daydream engine option, and also the default animated GIF player in File Explorer.--- Cast Screen -- The BLU Pure XL has native support for wireless screencasting. But there is no support for wired screencasting (the microUSB port is not MHL compliant.) To use the native wireless screencasting, you enable it through the Settings [Settings > Display > Cast Screen]. There are several ways to effect wireless screencasting. You have to have a target screen identified to cast to -- one that has chromecast or miracast built-in, or, for casting to a PC, an app that can grab the wireless signal, or, for non-Miracast compliant device, an HDMI dongle that is Miracast compliant.- - - - MIRACAST RECEIVER BUILT-IN -- If you are casting to a device that is already chromecast or Miracast compliant, you are (should be) home free.- - - - REFLECTOR 2 -- This is a screencast receiver software that installs on a PC that is not Chromecast or Miracast compliant. It works by processing the wireless signal broadcast by the Pure XL. It follows, of course, that your PC must have wireless capability activated, either internally, or on a wireless network. There are no dongles required for this solution, but the software costs $7. I have cast from the Pure XL to Reflector without any problems.- - - - DONGLES -- ChromeCast and MiraCast compliant dongles exist to provide non-compliant devices with receiver capability. They plug into an HDMI-in port on your receiving device (normally a TV.) - - - - CAST SCREEN QUALITY -- You are very likely to be disappointed with the quality of the cast picture. But this is not the fault of the phone. You will be casting from a 1440x2560 2K screen image to at most a 1080x1920 screen image, with a loss of 50% of the original pixels. While most screen casting software allows you to enlarge the image, that just makes the quality worse. This is just the state of the arts in screen casting technology. What is needed is the ability to cast a 2K or higher image. Maybe next year.HOT SPOT / TETHERINGThe BLU Pure XL can serve as a Hot Spot by tethering other devices to it for access to the internet. You set this up through settings: [Settings >> ""... more"" >> Tethering Or Portable Hotspots >> (then you have choices of Bluetooth tethering or WiFi tethering)].I tether my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7"" to the BLU Pure XL by WiFi because the Tab S2 is WiFi only, and I need the Pure XL's 4G LTE data link to use the GPS Tracking console when I am not near a WiFi source. Yes, I can also do GPS tracking on the Pure XL, but the Tab S2 gives me much wider view at the same map scale. Tethering works seamlessly -- very handy for giving 4G LTE Data capability to WiFi only device.BATTERYThe battery is a 3500 mAh, semi-permanent type, not intended to be user serviceable. It has a fast-charge circuitry that uses a 9 volt battery charge system that can recharge the battery completely in less than two hours. Every ten minutes on the charger provides an additional 10% recharge. While the back cover is removable, that is only to allow access to the two SIM card slots and the separate microSD slot.BATTERY LIFEBattery Life is very much a user variable as well as a function of the processor size and speed, screen size and resolution, and battery size. No phone with this much processing power, screen size, and resolution is going to have battery life comparable to a low performance, low resolution phone. It takes a high battery drain to run all that power. That is just a fact of life ΓÇô all the super phones (and this is a super phone) are going to have this problem ΓÇô and the only way around it is for the user is to manage battery consumption, or choose a lower performance phone.Battery size is also a design tradeoff between capacity and weight ΓÇô the higher the capacity, the higher the weight. At 3500 mAh, the battery is already big, and heavy. Making it any bigger is going to increase the weight of the phone, which in turn could adversely affect sales.Complaints of poor battery life on this phone is comparable to a VW buyer buying a Hummer, and complaining because the Hummer only gets 10 mpg instead of the 40 mpg they got in their tiny bug. It just isnΓÇÖt a rational comparison.All that said, you can significantly increase battery life by adopting these user-controlled functions and procedures:1) The highest battery drain is the screen. Adopting a dark wallpaper, or even better, an all-black wallpaper, very significantly decreases battery drain. And that has the added benefit that your screen items will be more visible ΓÇô actually pop out at you, which allows you to turn down screen brightness even more.2) The higher the screen brightness, the higher the battery drain. Turn down the screen brightness to just above what you need to read it.3) The next biggest battery drain is the octa-core CPU. Yes, it so fast that you can run all the apps simultaneously without a lag, and impress your friends. But running it fill bore by having every app open and running is comparable to running your car with the ΓÇ£pedal to the metalΓÇ¥ full throttle -- it is going to greatly increase your fuel drain and drastically decrease your mileage.Turn off features you are not actually using. Use the NFC stickers to turn on necessary features that are location dependent ΓÇô such as Bluetooth for your hands-free system in your vehicle. Back completely out of apps you are finished with so they are not running in the background.One day, scientists and engineers will bring us a tiny battery that can run our whole house for years ΓÇô but that isnΓÇÖt here yet. Until then, youΓÇÖll have to manage your battery yourself.NATIVE APPSFlashlight/Torch ΓÇô The native flashlight app is called ΓÇ£Torch,ΓÇ¥ and it is a Lollipop feature (IΓÇÖm told). It uses the camera flash LEDs as a light source. It will also flash on and off SOS style.Flappy Android: (Lollipop's equivalent of Floppy Bird.) This is a ΓÇ£secretΓÇ¥ game put in by the Lollipop development team. To access it, go to:[Settings > About Device > Android Version >(tap on ΓÇ£Android VersionΓÇ¥ four times quickly) > (An ΓÇ£Easter EggΓÇ¥ appears) >(tap on the Easter egg and it turns into a Lollipop) >(tap on the lollipop and it changes color) >(long-press the lollipop and it activates the Flappy Android game) >(To activate the Flappy Android, tap the screen each time)]MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, & PARTSBLU has maintenance and repair facilities in the US, supposedly stocked with parts. However, in general, BLU does not sell parts to individuals or unapproved repair shops. So if you are having problems with your phone, resign yourself to service by BLU, contact them and make arrangements to send your phone in for repairs. (www bluproducts com)*Within the warranty period ΓÇô You should make a warranty claim on any malfunction that occurs within the warranty period. However, donΓÇÖt expect that everything that goes wrong will be approved for free warranty service. The following items will generally be ruled to be user abuse, and not be covered by warranty ΓÇô- - evidence of being dropped (broken or cracked screen)- - evidence of force (broken or loose microUSB port)- - evidence of water damage (clouded and/or pixilated screen), and- - evidence of tampering (broken seals, missing screws, pry marks, etc.)Outside the warranty period, or warranty claim denied, BLU will still make repairs. But will likely require payment first.There are alternate sources for parts. The Gionee Elife E8 is an exact clone, and almost all parts are interchangeable with the BLU Pure XL. However, most part sources for the Gionee are in India.[...][...]*Extra chargers and cords ΓÇô If you want an extra charger and cord (one for home and one for the office), there are usually some used ones available on eBay for about $10.[...]** replace the interior spaces with a ΓÇ£.ΓÇ¥ to make the link workWARRANTYBLU Products, Inc.

"BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White","BLU","429.99","5","Package arrived today as expected from Amazon. The box takes shape of the phone. I thought they shipped me a book or something lol. Upon opening, this phone is super thin and light!!! Next to a Galaxy S6 edge, iPhone 6, 6 Plus, G3; you can definitely see the difference. Keep forgetting that it's in my pocket lol. After removing a few apps, I'm left with 10.7gb. But with options such as cloud storage and micro USB OTG flash drives, it won't be an issue. Couldn't uninstall Opera browser so I disabled it. FM tuner is an excellent feature (no need for data draws from internet radios or music stored on the phone). I am in the Houston area on carriers AT&T and one that uses T-Mobile towers and get LTE speeds. Not sure about the battery life yet but have seen a few reviews on the first gen, Air. The standby time is amazing like the G3 but it may be even better. Will update if so. I like that it comes with a sim card ejector, headphones, screen protector and case (which I plan on not using). Don't really like the onscreen navigation buttons. I rather the capacitive buttons like on the first gen. The screen is gorgeous like any AMOLED display. Rich colors and black blacks. Camera sensor is by Sony but it is so, so. But for $199 unlocked, it's hard to compare!Edit 2 - Sept. 25, 2015:Camera Performance - After a few testing, the camera is now considered good. It has a Sony IMX 219 sensor. The stock camera app has manual ISO, exposure and white balance, and anti banding. The app doesn't switch to landscape mode which leads me to install Google Camera. In auto mode: Surprisingly, by keeping the hand steady while snapping, it performs pretty good indoors. Focusing is almost there for it's aperture and I like to have my HDR always on. Take a look at the spicy tuna handroll in the photo. It's not edited. Only the S6 photo was cropped to match the image size of the Vivo Air. In the outdoor scene, you can see the lack of color reproduction. Once I installed an auto photo editing app, this phone can give others a run for it's money! Low light conditions give noticeable noise. With flash on at a close object, it can be overpowering and colors are slightly off. The front selfie camera on the other hand, is below average for a 5mp.Edit 3 - Sept. 27-28, 2015:Battery Performance - The camera performance test I did a couple days ago was part of this battery test. Hello to 3 days of battery life and 4hrs of SOT on a single charge for a 2050mAh! Standby time is amazing! On this charge, I consider my usage was light to moderate. I have 3 emails synced, Skype, adaptive display at 50-75% brightness, mobile data with LTE speeds always being on, camera stills, browsing the web, and FM radio when riding my Ninebot One. To recharge the battery from zero to 100, it takes about 90mins on a 2amp charger (I'm not using the included charger since it has a lower power output). (screenshots attached)Screen On Time - With the screen set to always on, adaptive display off, 50% brightness (still super bright at this setting), wifi and wireless carrier data disabled; using MX player with a 720 movie on continuous playback, I get close to 11 hrs of runtime! (screenshots attached)Edit 4 - Oct. 8, 2015: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"" If you can, stay away from updating apps that are already built into the phone because there are some (Google apps) that depleted my battery down a good bit. You can try and go into Applications in system settings and uninstall the update if possible. Go into google play store's settings and disable automatic updates. Just remember to update your apps that you've downloaded. Maybe Android 6.0 Marshmellow will be better...","246","helpful"

In auto mode: Surprisingly, by keeping the hand steady while snapping, it performs pretty good indoors. Focusing is almost there for it's aperture and I like to have my HDR always on. Take a look at the spicy tuna handroll in the photo. It's not edited. Only the S6 photo was cropped to match the image size of the Vivo Air. In the outdoor scene, you can see the lack of color reproduction. Once I installed an auto photo editing app, this phone can give others a run for it's money! Low light conditions give noticeable noise. With flash on at a close object, it can be overpowering and colors are slightly off. The front selfie camera on the other hand, is below average for a 5mp.Edit 3 - Sept. 27-28, 2015:Battery Performance - The camera performance test I did a couple days ago was part of this battery test. Hello to 3 days of battery life and 4hrs of SOT on a single charge for a 2050mAh! Standby time is amazing! On this charge, I consider my usage was light to moderate. I have 3 emails synced, Skype, adaptive display at 50-75% brightness, mobile data with LTE speeds always being on, camera stills, browsing the web, and FM radio when riding my Ninebot One. To recharge the battery from zero to 100, it takes about 90mins on a 2amp charger (I'm not using the included charger since it has a lower power output). (screenshots attached)Screen On Time - With the screen set to always on, adaptive display off, 50% brightness (still super bright at this setting), wifi and wireless carrier data disabled; using MX player with a 720 movie on continuous playback, I get close to 11 hrs of runtime! (screenshots attached)Edit 4 - Oct. 8, 2015: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"" If you can, stay away from updating apps that are already built into the phone because there are some (Google apps) that depleted my battery down a good bit. You can try and go into Applications in system settings and uninstall the update if possible. Go into google play store's settings and disable automatic updates. Just remember to update your apps that you've downloaded. Maybe Android 6.0 Marshmellow will be better...","246","helpful"
"BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Gold","BLU","134.95","5","Update: Android Pay is supported with a bypassBefore being skeptical about this new device from BLU, read and decide. This new handset have great features. I replaced my BLU Studio 6 LTE with this BLU Pure XL, and I do not regret the switch. The phone has great specs, with an awesome multi-task processor capable of handling all you open, my brother has the LG G4, and the G4 stays behind when multi-tasking. This phone has not lagged, and the fingerprint sensor now works at any screen, lock or sleep mode. The camera to my taste, does a great job. I am impress of how much BLU gave us a great device for the price. I used Waze, tether at the same time and the signal was never lost, or GPS signal lost. The phone doesn't get hot, and feels like a solid device.The phone comes with a FLIP phone cover, and an extra clear gel rubber case, as usual. It includes a USB adaptor, and the USB cable with the outlet power connector. It comes with a custom Android 5.1 OS, which in my opinion, works well with the device. One cons of the custom lollipop version is that there is no App Drawer, so I right away installed Google Now Launcher.With 64gb internal storage, expandable with a microSD slot, one cannot go wrong with this phone. Call quality is good, I have had not a complaint, like I did when I used to call with the BLU Studio 6 LTE. Speakers are loud, and image quality is damn good. Now, hopefully BLU keeps this flagship device up to date.","265","helpful"

But this phone out of all of them is the most user friendly and comfortable.It seems like keys are small - BUT they r not, i typed messages twice faster then on any other touchscreen phone.Phone is small phone and doesn't look like u caring a TV in your pocket. WebOS is already proved to be best developers platform, and i can say it's the most flexible and easy to use from all the other mobile OS i've used. Yes it doesn't have millions and millions of apps but you can find all apps you would NEED - and most of them are free.I also own TouchPad from HP and TTS functionality is just awesome! $5 touchstone makes it easy to recharge wirelessly.Some ppl say that this phone is slow - not true. Phone is fast. As i said - WebOS is very flexable so u can accelerate it / overclock. Any phone is going to be slow if u r running 20 apps without closing processes. Also some ppl left reviews saying that it's hard to close apps - actually thats a lie - process of closing an app is easiest from any other phone - u just swiping app-card/window up.So please people - before posting negative feedback about great products - READ MANUAL and fallow instructions!","6","helpful"

"HP Palm Veer 4G P160 Unlocked GSM Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, WebOS, Touchscreen, Wi-Fi and GPS - Black","HP","79.99","5","HP veer is a very sweet phone, with size so small. I loved webos and I love it even more on my small phone. The ability to do so much with such a tiny size blows me up. I kinda used impostah to force activate my HP veer and bypassed data plan from at&t thereof since I never wanted data plan on any of my phone. That was the whole reason of not buying phone from AT&T.Anyways, regarding phone, it is very sweet phone with ability to do a lot. I just wanted a phone, which functions like a normal phone does, but along can do small small things for me (like email checking etc.). I don't want phone to do everything for me as I have so many other things (laptop, desktop, tablets etc etc) to do it from. I wanted my phone to be sweet looking, easy to hold, stylish, and in budget. I bought it from amazon for around 85 bucks and without activating any data plan, it is a steal now. If I had to get a data plan, I would better buy expensive phones (galaxy, BB etc) from att. But this phone is for those who don't want to get into smartphone hassle, but still kind of want something fancy looking and in line with what is nowadays standard touch screen phone.I am going to enjoy my phone for next couple of years and will only look for new phone thereafter. Thanks HP for making so sweet phone, and special thanks to Preware/precentral guys for helping me bypass the regular activation process. Don't forget to donate few bucks to those guys as you are already paying dirt cheap to own such a beautiful phone (without data plan)... Read more about Impostah and force activation by googling how to actiavte HP veer without data plan, enjoy....","18","helpful"

But I got this for my kid, because I'd gone the cheapo route last time we had an upgrade with AT&T, and those freebie phones were just not cutting it, they were barely even functional anymore...and then just when we were anticipating an upgrade for them in December, and I'd promised them that, AT&T went and changed our upgrade cycle to 24 months, making us wait until MAY to get new phones. I wasn't gonna let AT&T make a liar out of me, so I came to Amazon in search of something that will hold them over....well, I'm not even sure I'm going to upgrade in May now, because I might let the lines go off-contract and look for a better provider. My son loves this phone, granted it's only been a few weeks and sometimes problems show up later, but so far so good.Stuff I really like:Memory is upgradeable via SD Card.I was concerned we might have to order a mini-Sim since my boy had the oldschool bigger chip, but went to the AT&T store and they used a thing that looked like a stapler to punch his SIM to the smaller size, quick easy and free fix.The color is nice.So far performance seems great.Price was reasonable.Other stuff worth mentioning: You get 3 screens to put your desktop shortcuts for apps on.

"HTC Radar C110E Unlocked GSM Phone - White/Silver","HTC","74.99","3","Just a few quick notes to help on your decision. Search comes up as Radar 4G but no where on phone does it say that. It may look like 4G, so not sure. Assume C110E, looks like 4G, HTC website is a joke, no model information.It looks like one from a USA Tmobile store but it is from Europe most likely Germany. No English manual go figure? Three stars *** because no US wall charger, only a 2 prong Europe model. Plan on buying one so this phone is not such a bargain. Tmobile SIMM card worked fine. Lots of setting changes for USA metrics. I may be sending back and spend extra $80 to get a USA version. More posts later as I resolve issues. Might have been four star**** if I did not have to fool with model. Bad out of box experiance!More important notes, no USA TMobile 4G support only edge. Took into local Tmobile store, they gave me a new SIMM card. This unlocked phone is like the iPhone features not supported. Also, it is lighter and very very little bit narrower, I compared side by side. Rest of Mango features are nice. Sorry to say this phone goes back and I am off to Tmobile store.","8","helpful"
"HTC ST-7377 Tilt 2 Unlocked Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, Touch Screen and 3MP Camera - US Warranty - Black","HTC","29.99","4","I upgraded from an 8125 smart phone. Had Windows mobile 5. This phone has 6.5. Found features removed from the OS, like alarm snooze and reminder snooze. There doesn't seem to be a way to control how long you want something to snooze. It's always 5 min. A few other minor features removed.For having a 500 MGH processor, it is unexpectedly slow. Not aggravating though.I don't talk on it much and I have to charge it about every 4 days. 5 to 6 days on the 8125.It doesn't take standard USB cable. Why did they change this? I guess so you have to buy their special cable. UNNECESSARY! Expect to pay for more hardware.I like the help feature. The manual is built in, and searchable.The voice recognition/command feature is AWESOME. No more recording voice dial. The phone can dial anyone in contacts by saying their name. Programs can be activated by voice. Just say ""Open Excel"". The phone retrieves all of my Excel files, so I can choose which one I want to open. Say ""When's my next apt."" The phone speaks back to you when your next apt. is! NICE!Can connect to multiple blue tooth devices. Nice feature.WiFi burns a lot of battery power. WiFi internet is slow. Phone ""Microsoft IE"" is heavy on the OS, processor and memory. Poor performance. Web pages see the phone as if it's a regular computer.Love the quick access of programs. Program tab is VERY customizable.Touch keyboard is great. Accepts ""fat fingers"" well. I love how slim the phone is and has the slide out keyboard. Slide out is missing some important symbol keys.This is another pocket PC. A laptop in your pocket. SO FUNCTIONAL. Not a perfect phone, but overall I think it's great. Very comparable to the Iphone. You can replace the battery on this phone. When the battery dies on an Iphone, you have to throw away the phone.","8","helpful"
"HTC Status ChaCha A810a Unlocked Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, 5MP Camera, Wi-Fi and GPS - US Warranty - Silver","HTC","269.1","1","I bought the phone because of the combination touch screen and key pad. The design fits my needs perfectly, however the memory is a huge fail. If you would like to download more than 1 or 2 apps, this phone is not for you. It comes pre-loaded with many applications that take up most of the storage space and they CANNOT be removed nor can they be transferred to an external storage card. I purchased a 32 GB card, only to find out that the pre-loaded applications cannot be transferred. I have spent many hours on the phone with an HTC representative who has basically said the only way to solve my problem is to remove the 2 apps I downloaded or just do a total and complete system wipeout to bring the phone back to its original state, which means all pictures, messages, phone numbers, favorite places, etc. are gone. It is a hassel to deal with the phone because I constantly get low memory messages, and I only have 2 small applications that I was able to download on it. I have tried to download additional apps, just to receive a message stating that there is not enough internal memory. While the phone does give me the option to maximize more space by moving items to the data card, once again, the phone will not permit items to be moved. I am constantly clearing out the cache just to access some of the phone's basic features. Also the phone will go on mute in the middle of a conversation when I have not touched the screen, (many times I will be on speaker) and the only way to unmute the call is to hang up and re-dial. In regards to the speaker, the quality is poor, it barely amplifies the sound. If you are still considering purchasing this phone, do yourself a favor and check out the internet blogs about this phone model and memory issues.","8","helpful"

I was shocked to see this phone come in a very generic box with a plastic insert that didn't really go w/the pieces inside.

Then the clincher -- although you could hear the other person on the line, they couldn't hear you. We took it our neighborhood Verizon store & was informed that this phone was just plane..bad..My first disappointment w/an Amazon vendor...so upset!..it's being returned 1st thing in the morning.","9","helpful"

"HTC Radar C110E Unlocked GSM Phone - White/Silver","HTC","74.99","5","In short, I love this phone. I currently own 2 of them. One for my wife, and the other for me. The first one I purchased was this one on Amazon, so I could decide if I wanted to switch from an Android device to a Windows Phone. Needless to say I was blown away. I was always a fan of the flexibility of Android, and loved adding custom software and Roms to my phone. My wife on the other hand just wanted a phone that worked consistently. Her HTC Mytouch4G was getting slow and buggy, so I decided to have her try a Windows phone since I had heard nothing but good things (We are on Cincinnati Bell, so an iPhone was not an option. Although I don't think I would have chosen that over the Radar anyway). When my wife got her Windows phone she loved the interface, and the integration with Facebook. She didn't like that MyFitness Pal app didn't have a barcode scanner (it does now), and that there is no Words with Friends (still isn't), but those were small gripes in comparison to having a phone that didn't hang and need to be rebooted daily. Speaking of daily, under typical usage neither of our Android devices would last more than 8 hours on a charge. The Windows phone will go a day and a half (still no blackberry) but much better. Well, as you may have guessed, I gave up my modded Android HTC G2 for a Radar as well, and haven't regretted it for a second. Having your hands on one of these things is believing. If you get a chance to try one out take a friend with an android or iphone with you. Go to Youtube and stream a video, and watch how much faster the Windows phone can do it. It is really amazing.Pros:Slick interfaceJust WorksGood Camera (Rear facing)Decent front cameraSolid HTC buildCons:Windows app market much smaller than Android or iPhoneUpdate 7/16/13 I Sold on my HTC Radar some months ago, and I have to say it held up really well. I still don't think you can go wrong with this phone, especially if you aren't heavily invested in another ecosystem.Additional Pros I left out originally:SkydriveThe con of the app market has been mostly mitigated with a lot of official apps released in the last year. Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Linked In, ebay, Amazon etc. Still no Instagram, but check out Instance for a good substitute if you want that functionality.","10","helpful"

"HTC Evo 4G LTE 16GB Sprint CDMA Dual-Core Android Smartphone w/ Beats Audio Sound and Built-in kickstand - Black","HTC","59.68","5","I am enjoying this phone very much. To pay under 200 dollars for a Re-branded One X is quite a nice treat. A word about the 16 GB memory on the phone... Only 2 GB is available for apps! While this is not a small amount compared to many mid or low range phones, I was quite surprised that this was the case here.... 9 GB was available on a separate partition of the same memory, so frankly HTC was just underestimating power users' demand.That said, App2Sd simplifies the process of moving many apps to the other partition, and I have yet to run out of space. The screen is a beauty, and this phone is a runway model in terms of looks, it is beautiful yet refined. The kickstand should be a standard feature on all phones, it is very handy. The memory card slot can actually take certain makes of 64 GB sdhc cards so do a search.The battery is average, and cannot be removed. However, aggressive power management sorts this out... Provided you are careful about the apps you install, for instance Skype is notorious for halving battery time. If you actually let the battery trickle charge from 85 percent to 100 you will see an overall increase in battery capacity after a few charges.The 4.7 inch screen is great to type on and looks gorgeous, in public this phone doubles your wow factor. The wifi is dual band, 5ghz has good range, and the phone does a good job for a phone of holding signal, and negotiation for bit rate. Since phones are limited by their size I suspect wifi signal will always be more problematic than tablets or laptops... This phone does well for its form factor.I have been pleasantly surprised by this phone, This was going to be a stopgap phone as I tried out Ting, I will probably not upgrade as soon as I had planned, I have no need.Two updates in the comments section.","12","helpful"

That's the first reason I decided to stick with HTC, and the one M8 promise to be handsome phone. Comparing with the competitions S5, as far as performance they are quite the same, maybe a difference in the camera. The Samsung has extra features like the fingerprint scanner, the hart rate monitor, etc that can make the difference if you enjoy having a phone with many feature. But for me is the daily working, and I got to say the phone beats S5 in daily use, the sound is amazing never heard a cell sound like it, the phone is the best looking phone in the market, the screen performs great outdoor with direct sunlight. And about the camera, maybe not that much megapixels but ultra-pixels performs better in low light environments and many pictures are taken in those conditions, in other conditions you will get good pictures. I'm getting about two days of battery life with regular/high use, remember I just got the phone, and when you get new toy, you usually play with it extra time to learn all the features. I got de European model because of the 4g band with Digitel in Venezuela. The phone picks 4g, and I got to say it really makes a difference upgrading to 4g, my patience is less stress.

"Huawei Mate 8 Premier Dual NXTAL10 64GB M.Brown","Huawei","494.55","5","The Mate 8┬áHuawei Mate 8 6.0"" 16MP 4GB RAM Dual Sim 4000 mAh 64GB Smartphone (Brown) (Brown)┬áis a fantastic device. The Mate 8 (NXT-L29) is the largest-screened high-end smartphone available that works with U.S. 4G-LTE networks. Moreover, it is arguably the fastest and most powerful of any smartphone available here as of mid 2016. The Kirin 950 chipset is blazing fast, but it also sips power. Apps load and execute lightning fast. The phone is tops in PCMark's Web Browsing test and total work performance score by a wide margin. Meanwhile, the Mate 8 is running Android 6.0 Marshmallow right out of the box. I received the NXT-L29 International Version, so setup was in English and quite easy and straightforward.The build quality of the Mate 8 is impeccable. There is already a ""tear-down"" review of the Mate 8 online if you want to see what it looks like inside. The IPS-Neo display looks great and is easily viewable at an angle (like sitting flat on a table) or in direct sunlight. I myself can't discern any benefit from screens with resolutions above the 1920x1080p of the Mate 8 on a smartphone. Plus, higher resolution panels use more power.The fingerprint scanner on the Mate 8 is one of the most important features to me. It is almost instantaneous and is extremely ergonomic with its placement on the rear. The finger print scanner also turns on the device and unlocks it in one fell swoop. My index finger naturally finds the finger print scanner when I pick up the phone with either hand.The 16MP & 8MP cameras are plenty good for what I need in a device which is mostly photographing my dog and friends, etc. The camera software has some cool features and also a professional mode. In addition, Huawei may be updating the camera software more here in the near future from what I have read. I decided the extra $100 or so for 64GB of internal storage and 4GB of RAM (vs 32GB and 3GB RAM of the cheaper model) were worth it for me as they make it a little more future proof.I am using Straight Talk wireless. So, I picked up a Nano SIM Straight Talk kit at Walmart. It comes with 4G LTE nano SIM cards for AT&T and T-mobile networks (it also includes every other conceivable SIM card size and type) . But, know the Mate 8 will not work with Verizon or Sprint 4G networks. Setting up the new service was painless and easy. I just phoned Straight Talk, and they walked me through it. They switched my service to the new nano SIM from my old phone's micro SIM within 15 minutes. They did most of everything on their end. All I had to do was install the SIM card and do a restart of the phone.I am already familiar with Huawei devices having had a good experience with one a few years ago. If you are unfamiliar with Huawei, know that they are now the third largest smartphone maker in the world. Of course, I did hear about Huawei possibly spying through their devices (more conspiracy theory than anything). Besides, they would not learn much interesting from me. The Mate 8 is a superbly crafted device, so hopefully that bodes well for Huawei's reliability.The only real gripes I have about the Huawei Mate 8 are Huawei's EMUI 4.0 android skin and the lack of selection of cases for the device. I am also unfamiliar with Huawei's commitment to updating the software with their devices as time passes. The Huawei Mate 8 is everything I was looking for in a new smartphone. It is just too bad they haven't released it here officially with a U.S. warranty.I have already requested a boot unlock-code for my Huawei Mate 8 (NXT-L29) as it has a very secure bootloader that I don't want to mess with. However, I will be rooting the phone and installing some of my favorite system apps. I just like having that extra level of control over the system software and apps on my android devices. I'm unsure if I will be trying any custom ROMs though, as this could be quite an expensive brick indeed.Finally, I had a great buying experience with Mega Mobile. I received a new Huawei Mate 8 NXT-L29 Mocha Brown 64GB and 4GB RAM brand new shrink wrapped in its box with all its accessories. As nice touches, a U.S. power adapter and a hand signed thoughtful letter were also included with my order.","30","helpful"

I will do my update first. I have had the phone for about 2 months now and the phone is still as beautiful as the first day I bought it. The only issue is there is ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT FOR IT! I knew it was a phone not really available in the US but I had seen a US support phone number for it. Well it turns out that number does not support the Mediapad. Why do I need support? I have had a few issues. A lot of play store apps don't work on the phone well. They will download, they will open, they will even work for a day. But then the next day they turn off. To get the to work you have to open each app every day. A little tedious.1. I have tried at least 20 ""alarm timer/ reminder"" apps and they all work fine for a day. Then they turn off.2. I like having a call recorder on my phone so I don't have to take notes during a phone call, or if I forget a number someone tells me. I have tried at least 12, they all work fine for a day!3. I have tried a bunch of other apps that need day to day operation and they don't continue to work.AND THERE IS NO SUPPORT! BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.If there is anybody out there that knows a fix, please let me know. I do like the phone, but I don't know if I will keep it. You can read my initial review below.Well I just received my Mediapad yesterday and what is there to say. I love it! At first glance, yes it is large, it feels quality, I like it. The first thing I noticed is that all of the two buttons on the device are on the right side. I am used to the volume rocker being on the left side so this will take a little getting used to. As I held it in my hand I think I understand the thinking behind the button arrangement. Since it is so large you would need a very big hand to be able to reach both sides of the unit to operate the buttons. With both on the same side you operate both of them with your thumb.So having it in my hand I turned it on to find the most beautiful screen I have ever seen on a phone. Large, bright, colorful, clear yada yada... At this point I headed to the T-Mobile store which was rather uneventful, being Verizon for the past 15 years I am looking forward to a change.So far it has just been 24 hours and have used the phone a dozen times and loaded a bunch of apps.

"Huawei Ascend Mate 7 Factory Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, White","HUAWEI","299.99","5","We recently upgraded our old iPhones, one to an iPhone 6+ and one to this Huawei Ascend Mate 7. After a few days use, the Mate 7 beats the iPhone 6+ hands down:1. As a phone, the Mate 7 picks up network signals much MUCH better (we use TMo). In our weakest spot at home, our old iPhones used to have one bar, the Mate 7 now has 2 bars, but the iPhone 6+ just dances between no bar and 1 bar. Why the 6+ couldn't even do a better job than our old iPhones really lost me!2. Data speed, when using TMo (turning off Wifi), the Mate 7 gets 30+M down and 16+M up in most areas of our home (still 10+M in that weak spot). iPhone 6+ gets only 5M in the best spot. All using OOKLA Speedtest.3. Everyday use speed, the Mate 7 is vividly faster than the iPhone 6+ in every test we can throw at them side by side.4. Music, that's supposedly Apple's area of strength. We are no audiophiles, but by our layman or laywoman's ears, the Mate 7 sounds better than the iPhone 6+.5. Fingerprint logon, the Mate 7 wakes up the phone with just one touch but the 6+ needs two (home then fingerprint). The Mate 7 is also more sensitive and no fail.6. Google Map, tap on an address, the Mate 7 automatically brings us to Google Map. That's the one thing we missed the most ever since Apple kicked out Google Map replaced with its own map (yeah, we always downloaded Google Map and used it, but missing THAT AUTO LINK!!) No doubt we'll use the Mate 7 when we travel!!!7. Overall feel, amazingly the Mate 7 looks better built and feels better. Sad for Apple. Sad.5 stars! 10 stars if Amazon allows!!","32","helpful"
"Huawei Mediapad X2 Tablet Phone (GEM-702L) 32GB Champagne Gold, Dual SIM, 7.0 inch, 3GB ROM - Unlocked International Model - No Warranty","Huawei","215","5","This may be a little unorthodox, but, just in case you were not going to read my whole review. I will do my update first. I have had the phone for about 2 months now and the phone is still as beautiful as the first day I bought it. The only issue is there is ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT FOR IT! I knew it was a phone not really available in the US but I had seen a US support phone number for it. Well it turns out that number does not support the Mediapad. Why do I need support? I have had a few issues. A lot of play store apps don't work on the phone well. They will download, they will open, they will even work for a day. But then the next day they turn off. To get the to work you have to open each app every day. A little tedious.1. I have tried at least 20 ""alarm timer/ reminder"" apps and they all work fine for a day. Then they turn off.2. I like having a call recorder on my phone so I don't have to take notes during a phone call, or if I forget a number someone tells me. I have tried at least 12, they all work fine for a day!3. I have tried a bunch of other apps that need day to day operation and they don't continue to work.AND THERE IS NO SUPPORT! BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.If there is anybody out there that knows a fix, please let me know. I do like the phone, but I don't know if I will keep it. You can read my initial review below.Well I just received my Mediapad yesterday and what is there to say. I love it! At first glance, yes it is large, it feels quality, I like it.

"Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black)","Huawei","229.99","2","I waited until I had this phone a few days before writing this review. Like everyone else, I am impressed at the build quality, lack of lag, call quality and overall value for a price under $300. But as has been pointed out by others, Huawei has quite a job ahead of it trying to make it in the US. As a country people in the US are used to buying subsidized $700 phones such as the iphone and top tier Samsungs for $199. Of course, they were paying thousands for these phones in the ""rent to own"" model where the top tier cell providers charged insane prices while keeping you in a forced contract. Thanks to T-Mobile Americans are finally starting to realize that buying your own phone outright saves you a lot of money in the long run - but top tier phones cost a lot more than $299. Assuming you're OK with a large phone, this is probably as good as it gets for $299.00. The build quality is not fancy, but it is solid and not cheap feeling for the price. The speed and lack of lag is excellent for normal day to day use, and the camera while not top notch is good for what people normally use a cell phone for. As for the cons:(1) I've used Android since it first came out and am having real problems with Huawei's ""Emotion"" UI. I realize that I can easily install a third party launcher, but I want to give it a bit of time to see if I get used to it. My problem with it is that it's pretty ugly (the icons and so forth look like something a fourth grader would have drawn) and the lack of an app drawer means that every time you install an app you either have to have it on a screen or place it in a drawer. This isn't a deal breaker since you can install an app launcher if you want, and for people who aren't used to Android it may be easier to learn.(2) I went into this knowing full well that there may never be a software update. Huawei is in the same position that the Japanese and South Koreans were in a few years back. They are unknown in the US and have a horrible reputation for not updating their phones. In terms of economics they won't sell enough of these to make it worthwhile to update Android in this model. The way I see it we're the first group of beta testers for Huawei in the US. A lot of people have asked me about this phone and I've been very complimentary so we're introducing the brand to the US. Now it's Huawei's turn. If they update Android at least twice in a somewhat timely fashion I'll continue to buy from them and help to spread the word, and they could easily become the next Samsung. If they don't, I'll use the phone for a while and pass it on to someone else (at $299 it's not the end of the world), but I won't buy another Huawei and will stick to more established brands.So to sum it up, this is a great mid-tier phone at a very fair price. If you go into this not expecting any software updates and knowing that you're not buying the very latest in technology you'll be very happy. And Huawei gets an opportunity to prove to the US market that they can be relied on - they can either step up to the plate and make a big splash in the US, or they can move on to the next phone to make a quick buck, abandon the first people who purchased their phones in the US, and sink into obscurity.Update: Unfortunately I had to return the phone and case today, but I guess I learned a valuable lesson by buying a no-name brand. I don't have T-Mobile LTE where I live, but I went to Atlanta this week where they have a strong T-Mobile LTE signal and saw that my display just showed 4G (not 4G Lte as is shown in Huawei's images). I went to a T-Mobile store where they exchanged my SIM card for a new one which worked fine in the store phones, but did not display LTE on the Huawei. I contacted Huawei support which could not even tell me if the display is supposed to show LTE but instead had me restore the phone (didn't help) and then told me that my carrier would have to help. T-Mobile doesn't sell this phone, so they did the best they could. I couldn't look at a manual (none up on the Huawei site) and when I asked Amazon users if any of them were seeing LTE on their screen no one answered. To top it off on the drive back home running just two apps (Google Maps for navigation and their music player) the phone would constantly slow down, inform me that I needed to close one of the two power intensive apps, and start bogging down with just these two apps running. Even my old original note with much less RAM and a slower processor has no problem running these two apps. As far as I could tell there is a huge memory leak in their software, since with just these 2 apps running the phone was running out of available RAM. Given Huawei's abysmal lack of help and information I decided that I would be better off with a Nexus 5. It's only $50 more. I'll miss the larger screen, battery and SD expansion, but at least it has current software, a manual and a large and involved user community. I may have gotten a defective phone, or else there may have been something else I should have done, but if this is the way Huawei is going to introduce themselves to the US they should save their time and money and not even try. I've been using Android phones since the original Nexus so I'm pretty tech savy, but when a company can't even tell you what icons are supposed to show on the display I can forsee a lot of unhappy customers. Amazon (as always)was great about taking it back.","41","helpful"
"Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black)","Huawei","229.99","5","I haven't been this satisfied with a cell phone since my old Nokia 5110. This is exactly what I want in a cell phone. The battery life lasted me 3 and a half days before getting to 10 percent. My previous cell phone (Majesty 796c) would get down to 50 percent in one day. Also, in my experience, it's quite fast and fluid. I haven't really had a problem with the screen being 720p instead of 1080p personally. Basically, if you don't see much of a difference between a 720p and 1080p Flat screen TV you should be good with this phone's screen resolution. Plus, they actually pre applied a screen protector! Great, because I suck at putting them on. I'm using a straight talk AT&T compatible micro sim card, so I get the 4G LTE service. Speeds up to 25gb up and 10gbs down. That's better than my Comcast connection. LOL If you're going to use it with straight talk service, you will have to set your APN settings though. You can get the settings from the Straight Talk site itself, or Huawei actually posted the settings in the questions answered section on Amazon. The Ascend Mate 2 doesn't have too much bloatware as well. I have about 12 gbs of data left from 16 gbs on board (I added 16 gbs with a SD card for extra space which you'll need to change the settings to save things to the added card by default). Some phones take up half the space for added on junk. As for the size of the phone, it's large. If you like loose fitting clothes with decent size pockets than it won't pose a problem, but I do have it all alone it that pocket. One more thing I'll address is the Emotion UI. Some people have problems with it. I personally have experience with the Ipod touch 2nd gen and Ipad 2. This UI feels closer to the Apple IOS than Andriod. Like having no app drawer, so I can delete an app without searching for it. I just put things in folders so they're organized in a way that can be found quickly. You can change it with a Launcher (i.e. Nero, etc.) but after I tried several launchers I found that the Emotion UI is a better fit for me. In closing, I LOVE THIS PHONE.PS I'm not good at writing reviews, so I apologize for the meandering way I wrote it. This is the longest review I've wrote about a product. LOL","43","helpful"
"Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty","Huawei","399.99","5","I pre-ordered this, based on using the Honor 5x, figuring it would be an appropriate upgrade.I have pre-ordered wisely.- Packaging: Some people don't care. I do. And this packaging is really beautiful.- Price: I bought into the Honor brand at $200 for my old Honor 5x. I'm not a big spender, so the $350 for the upgrade to Honor 8 was a bit of a stretch for my budget (that's $399 with a $50 account credit for pre-order! yeah!). After using this, NO buyer's remorse, it's a keeper. At this price point, it's a gem.- Camera: I'm not enough of a pro to know if the dual lens is much better. What I do know is that I got a bunch of really great shots, including many in low light (campfire.) There are some functions and modes (""beauty"" mode did not make me beautiful btw), so far I've only used the panorama mode and the filters for after. I'm not big into filters, and there are plenty of 3p apps for that, but sure, those are fun. So, even though I'm not a pro, I can confirm that this camera takes fast pictures, and they seem sharp with lovely colors. The low light pictures were a bonus, I'm hoping that I can depend on that more and more, with quality inside/evening shots.- Software: Two things to say about the software. First, I have very little patience for bloatware. And, there was very little on this handset. It was all tucked into a little folder, out of the way. No complaints. One item which Honor has on there which I love is the phone guard, which I can use to block calls, and control some privacy/data flow. Second: EMUI. When I picked up the Honor brand earlier in 2016 I was going from an iphone, and for me the EMUI is perfect. It feels nearly identical to the Apple IOS which means there was almost no learning curve. I have read some complaints about this on the internet, but I have to be honest, I just haven't found out what they are whining about. EMUI suits me just fine.- Appearance: The shiny and reflective surface is pretty neat in full sun, very layered. Maybe next time around I won't get white. When I ordered it white seemed like a good idea, but now I'm wondering if black might have been a better choice.- Handfeel: My phone is in my hand a lot, and I can get my thumb all over the display for one-hand texting. The really smooth glass finish all over the Honor 8 is lovely to touch, and I find myself taking the freebie plastic case off just to enjoy the slickness of the phone body. N.B. this thing is slick! By that I mean, it's slippery. It wants to slide, it wants to creep, it wants to go with gravity. The plastic case puts a stop to that.- Calling: I have only had the phone 4 days now, but so far no dropped calls or anything like that. I went camping over the weekend out along the coast, just trees and ocean. Good reception all over that. Does that mean it's a good phone, or that AT&T has good coverage? Either way, good good.- Memory: I just popped in my SD card that I've been using, done.- Battery: All day of heavy use for Fri, and Saturday. GPS, many photos, watched youtube videos, listen to music, and checked the Guardian news 100 times. Friday there was a lot of life left in the battery when I hooked it onto the power bank at our campsite. On Saturday, by the end of the long day it was down to 10%. This seemed great to me.- Fast charging: Yes! This is my first device with fast charging.I haven't had a crisis yet where I was running out of power, but I did notice that it fills quickly. After just a few days I'm beginning to feel that fast charging should just be standard on everything.- USB type C: Sigh. Time to buy some adapters.I'm still in the honeymoon period; Loving This Smartphone. I expect I will begin to notice some things after I've used it a while, but I can say that at the moment this is making me really happy, and it's a definite step up for me.","67","helpful"

"Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black)","Huawei","229.99","5","I have been using this phone for a few days. I just love it.The display is sharp and clear, the resolution is not an issue.The battery lasts for about three days for regular usage (checking emails, playing games for an hour, reading new from browser...)According to the spec, it only supports the Micro SD card up to 32GB. This is not true. I put a 64GB micro SD card into the phone, it works just fine.The 4G speed is super fast. I tested the speed with OOKLA speedtest app (I use T-Mobile), I got 38.89Bbps for download and 18.99Mbps for upload. This is even faster than my WIFI at home.The camera does not work as good as my previous phones at low light. I am going to use the flash to avoid this issue. The pre-installed Camera does not allow you to turn off the shutter sound. This is annoying. I installed the Camera360 app, and it allows me to turn off the shutter sound and it comes with many useful options.Update on 7/13/2014.I took a long trip this past weekend, after using the Google map's navigation for 8 hours and listening to music for over 5 hours without charging it in the car, the phone did not get hot. It even lasted for one more day. I was very impressed.Update on 10/8/2014An OTA update is available for the phone. I have just updated my phone.

"Honor 8 Unlocked Phone 32GB, Midnight Black- GSM- (US Warranty)","Huawei","399.99","4","EDIT (9/12/2016): Please read an addition to my review in the comments; I explain why I decided to drop my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars. I tried to edit my review here, but Amazon rejected my edits. I'm guessing the review was becoming too long...--I got into the Android world only recently with the Nexus 5X (I had only used iPhones before) and immediately grew to like it through the stock Android experience. I wasn't very pleased with the speed of the Nexus 5X and how sluggish many apps would run, but I didn't want to upgrade to the 6P (also made by Huawei) due to the larger size.Enter Huawei's Honor 8, which seems to be the perfect upgrade for me.THE POSITIVES:+The phone is very solidly built and put-together perfectly. It feels more expensive than it is+The design is slim and fits in your pocket easily. Unlike my Nexus 5X with the same screen size of 5.2"", the Honor 8 fits perfectly in my car's cupholder+This phone runs fast! Everything seems immediate with practically no discernible lag, from web browsing to playing music (Apple Music, to be exact) to even unlocking using the fingerprint reader+Battery life is better than my Nexus 5X. The Nexus would last me 8-9 hours on a charge through the day, the Honor 8 seems to be going at least 12 hours and more before I need to plug it in+Speaking of charging, the fast charge feature is no joke. I've found the phone to go from almost empty (3%) to 100% fully charged in little more than an hour! The phone also charges fast with any regular 2.1A USB charger, such as the Anker Powerport. (The Nexus 5X will only rapid charge with its included charger)+Forgot to mention call-quality: the phone does support VoLTE calling, which is indicated by a ""HD"" icon. VoLTE calls sound so clear that it is hard to believe you are on a cell phone. Non-VoLTE (or non-HD) calls aren't as clear, but are still pretty good quality. Of course, it all depends on your network and reception (I'm on T-Mobile, and usually get their LTE or 4G HSPA network most of the time).+The Camera takes some great NIGHT shots. Try taking a picture of the Moon using the Honor 8 and an iPhone 6; the Honor 8 will render the Moon clearly, while it appears as a white blob in the iPhone's shot. For daytime pictures, I honestly couldn't tell much of a difference between an iPhone 6 vs Honor 8's shots of the same subjects. That is not to say the Honor 8 still takes impressive daylight pictures, but I'm not sure that the dual-lens function has much bearing on the quality of them. The camera app is super-fast and can be ready to take a shot in a couple seconds, unlike the Nexus who's camera app is very slow and not good for trying to catch quick one-of-a-kind moments.THE NEGATIVES:-Very simply, the software out of the box is so different from what I was used to with stock Android. I don't like many of the tweaks and visual flair that Huawei put into their version of Android (called EMUI). It is obvious they are trying to make their version of Android look and run very much like Apple's iOS.However, after much tweaking with the settings and installing some other applications, I've been able to make this phone feel a lot more like what I was used to. I've listed my tweaks below under ""Tweaks to Consider""-As part of my tweaks, I tried to disable or at least hide many of Huawei's stock applications in favor of the Google apps. But one Huawei app in particular, HiVoice, keeps nagging me to give it permissions to access my content and what not. There is no way to disable that app and as much as I've tried to neuter it, I still get a random pop-up for it that annoys me. If any Huawei software engineers are reading this review, PLEASE give us the ability to disable or uninstall HiVoice. Or at the least, stop it from nagging constantly to gain permissions-The phone does heat up after several minutes of use. This is regardless of whether you are just browsing the web, listening to music or playing a game-Display and Resolution: On its own, the Honor 8's screen seems brilliant and renders text and images well. But compared side-to-side with the Nexus 5X, it seems to be pale in comparison. I've included pictures where I show the two devices side-by-side. I set both screens to display at 75% brightness; the Nexus screen (on the left) is obviously brighter than the Honor 8 (on the right). You will also notice that the Honor 8's screen doesn't display as much information or screen real estate as the Nexus does.NEUTRALS:+- Huawei will not win any awards for original design of the Honor 8. Just like the software, the phone itself is very much a copy of the iPhone 6/s, from the rounded edges to the glass screen to even the speaker holes. The back of the phone, however, isn't like the iPhone as it is glass. But then, I'd say Huawei was ""inspired"" by the iPhone 4/s or the Galaxy S7 for this aspect of the design+- Since the phone was just released, there aren't many cases or specifc accessories out yet. But I'm sure the selection will expand very soonTWEAKS TO CONSIDER:The biggest advantage of Android over iOS is the ability to tweak the software to your liking. If you are someone who is used to the stock Android experience from a Nexus phone, then consider the following tweaks I made to get the Honor 8 to a similar, if not the same, type of experience:-Launcher: (GOOGLE NOW LAUNCHER) I downloaded and installed the Google Now Launcher from the Play Store. This is the exact launcher that the stock Nexus devices use-Lock Screen: (MICROSOFT NEXT) I hated the fact that I couldn't get some notifications to disappear from my lock screen without having to unlock the device (in particular, I may want to keep a message from a friend visible to remind me to respond, but I want a spam email notification to go away).The solution I found was to download and install Microsoft's Next Lock Screen app from the Play Store. While it doesn't fully replicate the stock Android lock screen, it has pretty much the same functionality. In addition, you gain some useful quick shortcut icons on the bottom to open frequently-used apps. Most of all, you can keep the Next Lock Screen enabled and use the fingerprint-reader to still unlock the phone-Visual Voicemail: The Nexus supports Visual Voicemail within its Dialer app, but the Honor 8 doesn't. The only substitute is to download your carrier's own app for Visual Voicemail (I have T-Mobile and their app works almost seamlessly. AT&T also has an app in the Play Store)-Remove Bloatware: Huawei does ship the Honor 8 with a few bloatware apps, such as Booking.com, Facebook, Twitter and Lyft. But you can uninstall the apps you don't use-Other apps downloaded: I installed the Google versions of Gmail, Calendar, Clock and Photos to replace the Huawei versions. Although, the Huawei versions are simple reskins that still run the Google apps underneath, so this isn't a necessary tweak. I did this just for my own comfort and familiarity, simply as I am used to the Google versions.Additional Note: If you prefer to use Google's Clock app as your alarm clock, make sure to enable ALL notification permissions for that app (like Priority Notifications, Lockscreen notifications, etc.). Let's just say I didn't initially do that, and almost was late for work the first day I tried using this phone as my alarm...OVERALL:If I had rated this phone immediately after using it in its stock form for an hour, I would have given this 3 stars (for excellent hardware and terrible software out of the box). But after using this phone for several days and making the tweaks I described above, I have grown to like this phone enough to rate it a solid 5 stars. I like it enough that I have put away my Nexus 5X in a drawer and will be using the Honor 8 for the foreseeable future. I do recommend this phone for the power Android user and anyone else who is comfortable making tweaks, as well as someone who doesn't care about their software experience but does want a high-quality, fast and powerful phone. If you are someone new to Android who wants an inexpensive phone and can tolerate some sluggishness, I'd suggest getting a Nexus 5X instead. Or even a cheaper Android phone such as Blu. I don't believe the extra cost for the extra features of the Honor 8 will be worth it to the latter type of users.","257","helpful"

If you are someone who is used to the stock Android experience from a Nexus phone, then consider the following tweaks I made to get the Honor 8 to a similar, if not the same, type of experience:-Launcher: (GOOGLE NOW LAUNCHER) I downloaded and installed the Google Now Launcher from the Play Store. This is the exact launcher that the stock Nexus devices use-Lock Screen: (MICROSOFT NEXT) I hated the fact that I couldn't get some notifications to disappear from my lock screen without having to unlock the device (in particular, I may want to keep a message from a friend visible to remind me to respond, but I want a spam email notification to go away).The solution I found was to download and install Microsoft's Next Lock Screen app from the Play Store. While it doesn't fully replicate the stock Android lock screen, it has pretty much the same functionality. In addition, you gain some useful quick shortcut icons on the bottom to open frequently-used apps. Most of all, you can keep the Next Lock Screen enabled and use the fingerprint-reader to still unlock the phone-Visual Voicemail: The Nexus supports Visual Voicemail within its Dialer app, but the Honor 8 doesn't. The only substitute is to download your carrier's own app for Visual Voicemail (I have T-Mobile and their app works almost seamlessly. AT&T also has an app in the Play Store)-Remove Bloatware: Huawei does ship the Honor 8 with a few bloatware apps, such as Booking.com, Facebook, Twitter and Lyft. But you can uninstall the apps you don't use-Other apps downloaded: I installed the Google versions of Gmail, Calendar, Clock and Photos to replace the Huawei versions. Although, the Huawei versions are simple reskins that still run the Google apps underneath, so this isn't a necessary tweak. I did this just for my own comfort and familiarity, simply as I am used to the Google versions.Additional Note: If you prefer to use Google's Clock app as your alarm clock, make sure to enable ALL notification permissions for that app (like Priority Notifications, Lockscreen notifications, etc.). Let's just say I didn't initially do that, and almost was late for work the first day I tried using this phone as my alarm...OVERALL:If I had rated this phone immediately after using it in its stock form for an hour, I would have given this 3 stars (for excellent hardware and terrible software out of the box). But after using this phone for several days and making the tweaks I described above, I have grown to like this phone enough to rate it a solid 5 stars. I like it enough that I have put away my Nexus 5X in a drawer and will be using the Honor 8 for the foreseeable future. I do recommend this phone for the power Android user and anyone else who is comfortable making tweaks, as well as someone who doesn't care about their software experience but does want a high-quality, fast and powerful phone. If you are someone new to Android who wants an inexpensive phone and can tolerate some sluggishness, I'd suggest getting a Nexus 5X instead. Or even a cheaper Android phone such as Blu. I don't believe the extra cost for the extra features of the Honor 8 will be worth it to the latter type of users.","274","helpful"
"Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Sapphire Blue - GSM - US Warranty","Huawei","399","4","EDIT (9/12/2016): Please read an addition to my review in the comments; I explain why I decided to drop my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars. I tried to edit my review here, but Amazon rejected my edits. I'm guessing the review was becoming too long...--I got into the Android world only recently with the Nexus 5X (I had only used iPhones before) and immediately grew to like it through the stock Android experience. I wasn't very pleased with the speed of the Nexus 5X and how sluggish many apps would run, but I didn't want to upgrade to the 6P (also made by Huawei) due to the larger size.Enter Huawei's Honor 8, which seems to be the perfect upgrade for me.THE POSITIVES:+The phone is very solidly built and put-together perfectly. It feels more expensive than it is+The design is slim and fits in your pocket easily. Unlike my Nexus 5X with the same screen size of 5.2"", the Honor 8 fits perfectly in my car's cupholder+This phone runs fast! Everything seems immediate with practically no discernible lag, from web browsing to playing music (Apple Music, to be exact) to even unlocking using the fingerprint reader+Battery life is better than my Nexus 5X. The Nexus would last me 8-9 hours on a charge through the day, the Honor 8 seems to be going at least 12 hours and more before I need to plug it in+Speaking of charging, the fast charge feature is no joke. I've found the phone to go from almost empty (3%) to 100% fully charged in little more than an hour! The phone also charges fast with any regular 2.1A USB charger, such as the Anker Powerport. (The Nexus 5X will only rapid charge with its included charger)+Forgot to mention call-quality: the phone does support VoLTE calling, which is indicated by a ""HD"" icon. VoLTE calls sound so clear that it is hard to believe you are on a cell phone. Non-VoLTE (or non-HD) calls aren't as clear, but are still pretty good quality. Of course, it all depends on your network and reception (I'm on T-Mobile, and usually get their LTE or 4G HSPA network most of the time).+The Camera takes some great NIGHT shots. Try taking a picture of the Moon using the Honor 8 and an iPhone 6; the Honor 8 will render the Moon clearly, while it appears as a white blob in the iPhone's shot. For daytime pictures, I honestly couldn't tell much of a difference between an iPhone 6 vs Honor 8's shots of the same subjects. That is not to say the Honor 8 still takes impressive daylight pictures, but I'm not sure that the dual-lens function has much bearing on the quality of them. The camera app is super-fast and can be ready to take a shot in a couple seconds, unlike the Nexus who's camera app is very slow and not good for trying to catch quick one-of-a-kind moments.THE NEGATIVES:-Very simply, the software out of the box is so different from what I was used to with stock Android. I don't like many of the tweaks and visual flair that Huawei put into their version of Android (called EMUI). It is obvious they are trying to make their version of Android look and run very much like Apple's iOS.However, after much tweaking with the settings and installing some other applications, I've been able to make this phone feel a lot more like what I was used to. I've listed my tweaks below under ""Tweaks to Consider""-As part of my tweaks, I tried to disable or at least hide many of Huawei's stock applications in favor of the Google apps. But one Huawei app in particular, HiVoice, keeps nagging me to give it permissions to access my content and what not. There is no way to disable that app and as much as I've tried to neuter it, I still get a random pop-up for it that annoys me. If any Huawei software engineers are reading this review, PLEASE give us the ability to disable or uninstall HiVoice. Or at the least, stop it from nagging constantly to gain permissions-The phone does heat up after several minutes of use. This is regardless of whether you are just browsing the web, listening to music or playing a game-Display and Resolution: On its own, the Honor 8's screen seems brilliant and renders text and images well. But compared side-to-side with the Nexus 5X, it seems to be pale in comparison. I've included pictures where I show the two devices side-by-side. I set both screens to display at 75% brightness; the Nexus screen (on the left) is obviously brighter than the Honor 8 (on the right). You will also notice that the Honor 8's screen doesn't display as much information or screen real estate as the Nexus does.NEUTRALS:+- Huawei will not win any awards for original design of the Honor 8. Just like the software, the phone itself is very much a copy of the iPhone 6/s, from the rounded edges to the glass screen to even the speaker holes. The back of the phone, however, isn't like the iPhone as it is glass. But then, I'd say Huawei was ""inspired"" by the iPhone 4/s or the Galaxy S7 for this aspect of the design+- Since the phone was just released, there aren't many cases or specifc accessories out yet.

"Lenovo Vibe P1 Smartphone 5000mAh Touch ID 5.5 Inch FHD 3GB 16GB MSM8939 Octa Core","Lenovo","449.99","2","I had very high hopes for this phone. I'm coming off a contract Samsung Galaxy S5. I wanted a phone primarily with a stellar battery life (4000 mah +), second - decent design, and lastly, 16gb buil-in memory or greater. This fit all those things and more. It's a aesthetically beautiful phone. It processor is quick for all functions and it's relatively clean (almost no bloatware). The battery performance is excellent as you might imagine. It's a good value price-wise. Here are the MAJOR problems however: (1) Chinese - it's clearly built for the Chinese market - at least this version. I'm techie. After days of trying and research, there is no clear way I can figure out to get rid of the Chinese language remnants built-in. This is most pervasive in the Calendar, Contacts and Magazine thingy that displays random very pretty photos. It drives me nuts (2) More importantly, this phone REFUSES to stay on AT&T 4g. It Despite me being forced to configure a custom ""NXTGENPHONE"" AT&T APN, it periodically throughout the day reverts to 3G despite 2 other phones of my family staying on 4g in the same exact location. I am reluctantly sending it back. It's a shame because this phone has the exact specs, features and pricing I was looking for.PROS:- Price/value- Aesthetically very pretty for the price-point- Dual-Sim- Expandable Storage- Relatively Clean Android version- Built-in, easily accessible Flashlight app (no third party adware required)- Super battery life- Excellent photos and video- Built-in, automatic call recording option!- Dedicated battery-saving switch (Although, I don't think this is necessary on a phone with these specs. Better to have dedicated it to a camera or programmable function)CONS:- Refuses to stay on 4G network- Poor cell reception compared to otherse in same location- AT&T wap.cingular locked down - no way to delete it and default to another- Pervasive Chinese language everywhere - no way to get rid of it- Very few available cases","6","helpful"
"LG Xenon GR500 Unlocked Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, 2MP Camera, GPS and Touch Screen (Blue)","LG","129.99","4","I had a pantech duo c810 and I started having issues with it, like when I would call someone I could hear them but they couldn't hear me...I was told it had something to do with the microphone when I called pantech and that it would cost like $60 or so to fix, so I just decided to buy a new phone. I came across this phone on amazon. This phone is not unlocked but it works with AT&T and I have heard you can unlock it by looking for the code online supposedly. I like this phone because when you lock the screen the date and the time appear in large text/font when you hit a button to light up the screen when locked. The thing I don't like about it compared to my pantech is that you can't set it to where you enter your pin number every time you lock your phone. I have my pin set for when I turn this phone on and this is all I have been able to figure out with regards to using a pin # on this phone. So that's a downside that you can't lock this phone with a pin # all the time, just with a touch of a button. Also, I have found that if you text a lot the inbox gets full rather quickly so you have to delete your conversations daily like every other week or so depending on how much you text. I don't mind doing that but some of you might. The battery seems to be holding ok...but I have found that if you use a lot of the applications on this phone like going online, etc. it takes up a lot of the charge rather quickly, if that's the case and how you'll be using it I recommend you take your charger with you. I think I'm going to by an sd card for it in hopes it diverts that away from my battery's charge...I dunno if that will work or not but I think I'm going to give it a try anyway. Maybe it will help with the inbox texting issue...I dunno. Other then that I love this phone. The sound quality is nice and loud. For example, my grandmother who is hard of hearing could hear me on this phone! : D It has all that I need on it. it takes a while to get used to the touch screen aspect of it but you get used to it rather quickly...at least I did. I recommend you buy a screen protector for it as well as a hard snap on case when you purchase this phone all at the same time as you will come to find you need it. I recommend the hard snap on case because if you are a person like me who drops their phone a lot then it will protect it and this phone is so light the case adds a little bit more weight to it (not much) but just enough to where you feel more comfortable holding the phone and more comfortable to the point that you feel like you won't drop it as much. Also, you touch the screen to dial and such so that is why I recommend you getting a screen protector for it. This phone also comes with the 2 holes in it for a lanyard just so you guys know : ) Otherwise I would recommend this phone.","23","helpful"

"LG V10 H901 64GB T-Mobile- Space Black","LG","293.75","4","The price of this device has dropped substantially since launch. Originally I would have never even thought of recommending this glorified g4, but now at the lowered price it is the perfect utilitarian phone.Display:The display is vibrant, brighter than most amoled panels, and gets darker than any other LCD. The black levels are better than most LCDs but not great compared to an amoled. The secondary display produces noticeable blacklight bleeding which is a bummer but liveable. My unit had a very accurate white balance unlike most that have a noticeable blue tint, I don't know if it is just my unit or if lg updated the display calibration with marshmallow.Performance and ui:Performance is great, lg's user interface was once known to stutter like touchwiz, but now it performs just like you would expect from any proper flagship. I never experience dropped frames and the whole UI is always running at a stable 60 fps. The fingerprint scanner is fast, but the first try fails pretty often. The ram management is good but the android system itself consumes more ram than a nexus due to the heavy skin.Camera:The great manual features really show that lg has matured and is starting to implement their own unique features. It records 4k at a bitrate higher than any other phone at the moment and the automatic mode does an amazing job of showing accurate colors, even when recording under artificial light. One area that can improve is low light performance.Audio:The lg v10 is a huge step up from the g4 in terms of audio quality. The separate ess sabre DAC chip and opamp show big changes from the g4's mediocre audio quality. The amp is powerful enough to drive even the most demanding headphones like the akg q701 easily, and the DAC removes some of the hissing commonly produced by integrated snapdragon DACs while making the music sound a bit fuller in tone. Even though the speaker is only a mono bottom facing speaker, it is pretty decent sounding and incredibly loud. Makes my HTC one m8 speakers sound quiet in comparison.Battery life:The only area that prevents this phone from being perfect in my opinion. I get around 3 and a half hours of screen on time with heavy use, 4 hours max. This is not a problem if you have a spare battery but it still is not an excuse for why the much larger lg v10 has the same battery capacity as the lg g4, lg g3, and the lg g2","24","helpful"

Now this may not be typical, but a slight word of caution: i have big hands, so this phone fits great, but I don't feel very confident walking around moving this as i would a normal sized phone. The phone is kinda slick, and the size (in smaller hands) might make you a little nervous handling it. Thankfully, they're plenty of options when it comes down to cases that offer grip, and protection. I have one on the way as i type. Other than that, the phone is a giant freakin win!!.....Why are you still reading this? GO BUY IT","26","helpful"
"LG G3 Stylus 3G D690, Dual Sim, 8GB, Unlocked (Gold) -International Version (No Warranty)","LG","164.99","5","I bought this LG G3 Stylus for my SO. I specifically chose the G3 Stylus option for him because he has manly hands/fingers (obviously). Sometimes he gets what I call the ""fatfingeritis"" where he goes to type something and ends up hitting a million keys at once. The stylus is perfect for someone like him. It is very sleek and tucks away into it's built-in hole, very well. He doesn't feel awkward holding it and feels it has a good circumference for him to handle.The phone itself is beautifully crafted. LG did a great job design-wise. The volume up and down buttons on the back allow for excellent ease of use. We like that they're separated by the power button as well. The buttons can be customized to operate other functions of the phone, such as the camera. If you do not wish to have that option, it is easily able to be switched off. I personally loved that when the camera is up, I can simply push the volume down button to take a selfie, for instance. There isn't that awkward messing around trying to get situate your thumb to push the button while attempting to get the right angle. Ladies, you know what I'm saying, right?! Not that my SO really cares about that option! HahaAnother thing my SO really liked was the slight curve of the phone. He felt really comfortable carrying the phone around without a case because he felt it fit perfectly with how his hand naturally holds the phone. With his job, however, we did buy him a case/holster combo. That review is posted as well. It is an amazing case!The specs on this phone are pretty awesome as well.The screen is 5.5 inches, which is pretty decent size in this day in age. My SO likes the larger screen because it makes for easier reading and less squinting. The rear camera is a nice 13MP. It is not the highest of phones out there but is decent for what he uses it for. This is a 3G capable phone and has an OS of 4.4.2 preinstalled out of the box. To determine the OS update, you can go through your service provider.","29","helpful"

This is 100% original LG phone and please ignore all the reviews where they claim it is not. It is exactly the size, shape and form as described. Works flawlessly! Connects to my ATT microcell too. The only minor issue is that when you reset to factory, it defaults to Japanese language. But it takes one click to move it to English and i really dont see that to be any issue. The other thing is that the keyboard is the old style but it took me about 30 seconds to download google keyboard from google play. Honestly, i think this is an awesome phone for the price and features and service you get. If you have any second thoughts, trust me on it and go for it! You will love it too","30","helpful"

"LG G4 Unlocked Smartphone with 32GB Internal Memory, 16 MP Camera and 5.5-Inch IPS Quantum Display for GSM and CDMA, US Warranty (Black Leather)","LG","324.84","5","Great phone. Received the US991 model, which apparently is the US Cellular model, but there was no US Cellular software on the phone, just LG's version of Marshmallow out of the box.No carrier bloatware, clean LG interface. Smooth, quick response time, sharp looking screen with nice colors and contrast.Build date noted as 4/2016, so Amazon is not selling old phones (purchased directly from Amazon.com, not a 3rd party seller). I am aware of the boot loop issue, but given these are current builds, I am confident the newer manufacturing line is fine, however, I will update this review if I do run into any issues.I also have a Samsung Note5 (work phone), which is a technically superior unit, so it should blow this away, right? Wrong. Real-world speed with everyday tasks (internet, email, etc.) is effectively the same (the Note5 is a few ms faster launching most apps), however, surprisingly, the G4 is able to easily toggle back and forth between various open apps; the Note5 seems to do this a bit slower. Oddly, with no other apps open, the G4 performs much better with Google Chrome and Java than the Note5. If your primary use is the internet, then the G4 is the hands-down winner.Although very capable, the G4 is a step slower than the Note5 when used for 3D gaming. Since I don't really play games that much, it's not really an issue for me, and again, the G4 is more than capable, it just doesn't have the same fluidity the Note5 has in this department.Is the Note5 superior to the G4? In strict technological terms, yes. However, the LG G4 has less custom ""bloatware"" from LG than the Note5 has from Samsung, and as a result, real-world performance (sans 3D games) is nearly identical. Couple that with the fact the Note5 is going for nearly double the price of the G4, it seems unfathomable to spend $250+ more to get the Note5 for a few more FPS and that snazzy pen (unless you really NEED the pen).ALSO, if you are into sound, the Note5 does NOT have APTX (verified with CSR), while the G4 most certainly does!","30","helpful"

The main (and most impressive) positive about the LG G4 is the camera; I've never had a better camera phone. The picture and video quality is impressive. I also like that the screen is 5.5 inches (which fits well in my baseball gloves for hands). The one negative (and really the only negative I've found so far) is the touch sensitivity while texting/typing. Almost every time I send a text, the keyboard misses one or two of my space-bar touches. It definitely gets annoying; I've downloaded other keyboard apps, to no avail.","30","helpful"

"LG P970 Optimus Unlocked Android Smartphone with 5MP Camera, Wi-Fi, 4-inch Touch screen - No Warranty - Black","LG","120","5","I've been using my LG 970 Optimus Black for two months now and I simply love it! I bought it unlocked for use in Uruguay, South America. It's light and slim, very comfortable to handle and use, with an awsome display, very clear and bright, even under direct sunlight, and also very responsive to the touch. Very fast on the Internet and mail. It also takes very good pictures with or without flash, with lots of settings to personalize your shots as you wish. I've downloaded many cool applications from the Android Market, most of them free or with very low cost. The only thing I'm not completely satisfied with is battery life. With a moderate use of Internet, WiFi and 3G on only during the day, it lasts less than a day. However, after installing Juicedefender Ultimate from the Android Market, it now lasts aproximately a day and a half ... not that bad. But its excellent performance and sound quality greatly compensate for this drawback.January 9, 2012.After 5 months of use, I've kind of fallen out of love with it... well, not completely, but it's not my prince charming any more... I've had a serious event of denial to reboot after running out of battery, and had to take it to the service where the only option was to make a hard reset, thus losing all my personal settings and downloads, luckily not my pictures which were stored in the mini card! I read a blog on this rebooting issue, and apparently it happens frequently with this model, also when you try to block the display with the on/off button. I'm very attentive now to the battery level and have downloaded a blocking-display application, so that I don't have to use the power button to do it. This has worked so far.March 5, 2012.2 months having past since my last review, I must say that I've run out of battery three or four times, and also had to turn off the phone because it had frozen, and I had no problem whatsoever upon turning it back on. I made sure each time to wait some minutes before turning it on after turning it off or starting the battery charge, perhaps that made the difference. In summary: I'm very happy with my LG 970 again!","30","helpful"

"LG OPTIMUS L7 P705 Factory Unlocked International Version GSM Android Phone No warranty - Black Pink","LG","150","5","I've had about 2 months to play around with the phone and am very pleased so far. I owned a HTC Inspire for 2 years before purchasing this so my battery and performance expectations were already pretty achievable. The phone arrived fairly quickly and came with a male micro-usb to male usb cable, an AC to female usb wall adapter and all the manuals. After the first initial charge I plugged in my SIM card and turned it on. I'm currently on a Family Mobile cell plan and works just fine after a few setting changes. Search for Family Mobile APN settings and it will show you how to configure your phone.Hardware:The phone is very sleek. I bought the white model and get compliments on how nice the phone looks frequently. At first I was surprised at how light it was but now the weight seems very natural. Some people dislike lighter phones because they don't feel as sturdy but it personally doesn't bother me. The back cover has a bit of a flimsy feel to it, but unless you're swapping out SIMs, MicroSDs or batteries frequently you won't notice it that much. The physical home button, the volume rocker and the tactile back and menu buttons are all sturdy and responsive. The screen lock button on the top right of the phone seems too recessed into the phone for my liking, but i'm sure it helps with not accidentally unlocking your screen. The AUX jack on the top left of the phone gives a snug fit and makes good contact with the male end of the cord.Software:To start out, I absolutely love Ice Cream Sandwich. It combines aesthetically pleasing menus with tons of features. One of my main concerns with buying this phone was everyone's complaint about the single core processor. My old HTC Inspire was also a single core processor phone so maybe that's why I don't notice it that much but i've yet to experience any sort of significant lag. This being said, I also compulsively hold the home button down and close any applications i'm done using so it doesn't eat up my process allowance and battery. I'm sure if you were to leave tons of apps running in the background or if you game on your phone it might under perform for you. Video watching on this phone is very enjoyable as well. Whether it be internet streaming or a local file the picture quality is quite impressive. Playing a Blueray quality video file on the phones stock video app plays without lag or buffering which is a huge plus. Screen brightness ranges from very bright to almost off but lacks an auto brightness feature. Rooting was fairly easy once I found the right software. I could not SuperOneClick it but the LG flash tool worked fine. The camera takes decent quality pictures, but the flash is weak. This is a main weak point for me because I like to use my phone as a flashlight, but now I can't.Battery Life:This was the main feature that drew me to the phone. The battery life on the HTC Inspire is HORRIBLE so I wanted to make sure not to make the same mistake twice. Average life seems to be around 12 hours with medium use for me. Juicedefender helps quite a bit, but I also have screen brightness set to 60% (which is pretty bright). I mostly only text, browse the web, and make the occasional phone call so I think 12 hours is pretty reasonable. On the HTC Inspire I would have got 3 hours, so no complaints here. The one thing i've found to REALLY kill the battery is streaming movies and music on your mobile network. When you're connected to Wifi it's not as noticeable, which I almost always am, but for some reason mobile internet drains it. Light to no use and I think the battery would last well over 24 if not 36 hours.Overall I'm still in love with this phone, especially for the price. For someone who is not on a contract (which I am not) ICS + good battery life + factory unlock + sleek design + under $200 = an awesome phone.TLDRPros:Interchangable long life batteryIce Cream SandwichAttractiveLightCheapCons:Low intensity flashCould be sluggish for some usersAwkward screen off button","31","helpful"

"LG Google Nexus 5 D820 Black 32GB GSM Unlocked (Certified Refurbished)","LG","179.99","5","My refurbished Nexus 5 arrived in new condition and worked perfectly. It comes in a generic box with a 3rd party charger and no documentation or manuals. Please note that a SIM card removal tool was not included in the kit. Every new Nexus phone comes with a tool which can be used to eject the sim card but this refurbished phone does not come with the ejection tool. However, something like a paper clip will work just as good as the official tool. I thoroughly tested all aspects of the Nexus 5's operation including cellular, WIFI, text messaging, MMS messaging, and everything was in perfect working condition. The overall phone was in like new condition with no noticeable signs of wear and tear. The screen was scratch free and looked new. I think it's an awesome deal for the money. This item was ordered from BuySPRY. I highly recommend this item.Update: I recently ordered a 2nd refurbished Nexus 5 from BREED. I didn't intend to switch vendors but when I reordered the item, Amazon chose BREED instead of the vendor I purchased my first Nexus 5 from as described above. This time the phone arrived in an official looking LG box which contained a white Nexus 5, a 3rd party charger, and no SIM ejection tool. The phone was in new condition just like the one I received from BuySPRY, and powered up and worked fine. However, since I ordered a black phone and received a white one, I returned it to BREED and ordered a new one from BuySPRY. BuySPRY sent me another Nexus 5 in perfect working condition. The phone was in new condition, and powered up and ran great. I upgraded the software to Android Marshmallow and my daughter has been using it for a week now with no issues.In summary, I received a total of 3 refurbished phones (I kept 2 and returned 1) and they all worked great and were received in like new condition. I'm also pretty sure Amazon.com is fulfilling the orders for both BREED and BuySPRY so I don't think it was the vendor's fault I received the wrong color phone. I wouldn't hesitate to place an order with either vendor in the future.I am did not receive any compensation or discounts for this review. I have absolutely no affiliation with the vendors or with Amazon.com. I'm just an average Joe who loves Nexus phones!","34","helpful"

"LG G4 Unlocked Smartphone with 32GB Internal Memory, 16 MP Camera and 5.5-Inch IPS Quantum Display for GSM and CDMA, US Warranty (Black Leather)","LG","324.84","3","Despite giving the LG G4 3 stars, I did find it to be a mostly enjoyable experience. Here is a breakdown:Pros:+1080P images on the screen look excellent+The speaker on the phone is actually decent+Still uses the microUSB standard+The lock button is position on the back of the device. This is great because your hand naturally rests on the back and makes a quick and easy unlock+The camera is top notch! 16MP is pretty great on a phone and you will not be disappointed.+The leather backing is really nice to hold and gives a moderate amount of grip. Most days I go without a case because I love the leather.+Ability to change the battery and add a microSD card! I missed the ability to upgrade my storage from when I had a Galaxy S5.Cons-The backing pops off every time I remove a case from my phone and I am afraid it will break every time-The LG UI is pretty restrictive by Android standards, though I was pleased to see Marshmallow 6.0 out of the box.-The battery is pretty bad. This is one of the biggest reasons I gave the LG G4 a 3 star rating, and why I ultimately got rid of it.-Sometimes Apps bug or crash. I am sure this is just a software issue as the G4 has pretty good specs besides.-The screen is very dark. This was also a big concern for me because in the summer time here in Alaska, we have sunlight most of the day and damn it's bright!Overall:The LG G4 was an excellent phone besides the lacking battery life and low brightness screen. For $300 it is a great buy and it even comes unlocked!","35","helpful"

This is a good picture, text, and voice phone, low tech and easy to use. Pretty durable too, it can withstand the everyday use and occasional drops. With Verizon service it receives great reception and is reliable.This is my second phone of this model. The first I recently dropped in gallon of paint, which I quickly took out and rinsed off with water. (Didn't know about the bowl of rice absorption trick then). I took the phone apart, cleaned off all the paint and amazingly the only part that was broken was the microphone. After paint and water I was still able to text, take pictures, call outbound and receive calls inbound with ability to hear the caller on the other end. However, with a broken mic, they could not hear me. Impressive.","46","helpful"

Checked IMEI on Ting Mobile and Tracfone and both are good to go (US, north carolina). I was surprised tracfone's service is compatible with it. (haven't started either service yet)Easy one-click root and everything. Came with android version 4.4.2. I installed the Xposed Installer along with the Apps Setting module and now I can change the DPI settings for each app individually. I can make the text as small as I want to make use of the 2k (1440p) screen.Screen does overheat when left on max brightness for long periods of time. But I'm fine with the screen brightness at 40%, I rarely use it outside.I don't recommend anti-glare screen protectors with this high resolution screen. Adds a bunch of annoying noise to the screen. Random points of color you wouldn't notice on a lower resolution screen. Get one of those Clear/HD screen protectors.I recommend Moon+ Reader for e-book reading. Pre-download all the google translate stuff too, being able to translate from images instantly is amazing. AndrOpen Office for Office documents is a good tool to have on hand.

"LG Google Nexus 5X H798 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Hexa-Core Android Smartphone w/ 12.3MP Camera - Carbon/Black","LG","394.98","2","The phone itself is wonderful. My two star review is based on the abysmal customer service that LG provides.Two weeks after receiving my phone, the headphone jack stopped working. This is a simple fix, only requiring the back cover be removed and the jack swapped out. I contacted LG and asked them to perform only this repair since I got lucky with a phone that worked well and to please not remove my glass screen protector that had been on for just one week.Here's what their repair department did:- They removed my screen protector- They then scratched my screen- They damaged the headphone port on the body of the phone (see below)- They dented the back of the case (looked like someone jammed a tool into the jack to pry the back of the case off)- They replaced the mainboard, stating that the phone was shutting itself off - something it had never doneThis wasn't surprising to me. Two years ago I sent a phone in for dust under the front camera after having it a month. They damaged that phone even more.I've called and emailed LG asking them to send me a new back cover. Their customer service is set up so that you can only be escalated once and those supervisors cannot do anything but offer to have you send your phone back to the place that damaged it in the first place. Contacting via email causes you to hit the same wall, where no one can actually do anything to help. This customer service is appalling.Beware of LG.","50","helpful"
"Microsoft Lumia 640 XL LTE Dual Sim Black 8GB (RM-1096) Unlocked international model- no warranty","LG","255.99","5","Best of the best. There is no question in my mind that Microsoft leads now in innovation and design. I got my first Lumia 520 as a temporary replacement for a malfunctioning iPhone and it was love at the first sight. Now I got this 640 Xl, its mine not like an iPhone or others and it is wonderfully designed, fast operating system and great battery life. Ordered and came in less than 1 week. Installed my microsim from ATT and it was running smoothly. The only issue was it came from China or HK and everything the screen instructions were in chinese...so I got in YouTube and found a clip explaining how to change the language to english and with a little bit of imagination it took me a couple minutes to do it. The double sim card is going to be handy since we travel overseas and I am sick of ATT overpriced rates. By the way both cards appear to be ""active"" so I will be able to choose and pick on the go which phone number to use. Another little issue is that the charger that came with the phone is a weird one ( I think I have seen this type in the UK) so I use another USB cable but it must be a thick one like my Surface 3 otherwise there is a message that the charging process will be slow. By the way, no need of expensive cases unless you are prone to dropping things. The 640 XL fits perfectly in my jeans front pockets.So...it is a great phone and trust me..I am a recovering appleholic that still hangs to his iPad mini but now is sold to the idea that for now the future in technology and design is in Microsoft.Five stars because this phone is more that what I was expecting and now ai am ready for W10","50","helpful"

This phone has a full HD Display, 440 ppi, great battery and a snapdragon 800 for $240 ??!! Phones will lesser specs like the HTC one M7 sell for $100 dollars more. Even phones with similar specs like the S4 are also $100 more.This phone has a great display. Txt is very sharp and is easy to read. The color contrast isnt great though.

The snapdragon 800 isnt the newest and badest chipset out but it still a beast. Loading sites and clicking on articles is blazing fast. The phone feels very light. Also the bezels or ""frame"" of the phone is very skinny too. In other words the phone is mostly screen unlike phones like the htc one series which has such big bezels it's a turnoff for me.

In other words this phone cant be perfect or it'd be too good to be true. I wondered why a phone with these specs could be so cheap, well it's probably the build quality. Not saying I have issues now, but I doubt this phone will last years like an Apple or Samsung. What else...camera is decent. Not the best photos but it's fast at least. Speakers are loud but dont compare to the htc boomsound speakers but neither does any other phone. Battery is very good so far. The buttons on the back setup is not bad at all. The idea of the volume and on/off buttons being on the back really turned me off initially but I kind of like it.

"LG Electronics LG G3 D855 16GB Unlocked Cell Phone - Unlocked (Titan)","LG Electronics","249","5","I use StraightTalk, so I didn't want to wait for AT&T and their slow updates- I'd rather wait for LG's quicker updating. That's why I went with this version. I also went with this version because it has the Qi charging capability built-in. No need to buy another battery cover, or even worse AT&T's decision to go with the other version of charging. So, I went with the Korean version.Now for the phone itself:As you can see, the bezels are small, and this is great! If you are like me and want a big screen for games, videos, web, camera, etc. than this is the right phone. It feels absolutely great in the hand even with the size- I thought maybe a thinner phone might work better, but after having this phone for awhile, I disagree with that statement because the curves of the back and the small edges make this perfect for the hand to hold. This is the same size as my 5"" phone, and only a tad larger than the Galaxy S5f with a better feel in my opinion.LTE you ask? Works great with LTE from StraightTalk (uses AT&T towers). 30 up and 30 down, so if you were worried this version might not work, well it does for me in the Dallas area.You can go read much more extensive reviews on how great this phone is, but I'm a bit of a phone nut and have lots in my drawers. No buyers regret on this phone and I highly recommend it if you are looking for a bigger screen and not so big in the hands. Great buy.","83","helpful"

The proprietary charging/headphone connector can malfunction, causing the phone to become stuck in headset mode. So the phone will not make *any* external sound whatsoever. No ringing. No voice. No games. No music. Just use your favorite search engine and look up KP500 no sound. This appears to be a fairly common issue. Ours broke after only 2 months of extremely light use.","6","helpful"
"LG Optimus GT540 Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Phone with 3 MP Camera, Android OS, Touch Screen, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth--International Version with No US Warranty (White)","LG Electronics MobileComm USA","118","5","As far as the phone itself goes. It's great! It's no Samsung Galaxy or HTC EVO , or whatever high end smartphone you want to name... But it is a great little phone for the price tag. It was received in a non sealed box ( inside the sealed shipping package of course ) . The battery was fully charged ( not in phone ) and the phone already has Android OS 2.1 installed on it. Leading me to believe that it's perhaps refurbished or ""pre-prepared"" as you can get these phones like that at some retail stores... But none the less, the phone is scratch free complete with protective film on front back and edges. The phone is quick and lag free even after i loaded it up with apps. I have no complains on the performance of this phone.** I knew this going in.. but some of you may not have done your research. So let me shed some insight on using this phone in the US. **You have 2 GSM providers to choose from in the US T-Mobile and AT&T ( all other GSM providers you might find in the US are piggybacking off of the AT&T or T-Mobile network and use the same 3G frequencies ) - Both of these providers are using dual bands for their 3g UTMS frequencies : AT&T uses 850Mhz / 1900Mhz - and T-Mobile uses 900Mhz / 2100mhz . This Phone does support these frequencies , but only the BASIC GSM frequencies . But when you are talking 3g signals, Your unlocked phone needs to have support for both frequencies as UTMS that your US GMS provider requires in order to pick up their 3g signal. And you can see that this phone only supports UTMS 900/2100 dual. So getting a 3g signal in the US on this phone is simply impossible. You'll be stuck on 2G/EDGEHOWEVER..... What this phone is great for , is 3G connection on almost every other continent except for North America. In Europe and Asia this phone will grab a 3g signal the moment you land in the country ( provided you have an active SIM from that country) . Reason being is because most countries outside of US, Canada and Mexico all have a single UTMS frequency for their 3G.. which is 2100Mhz ... So Therefore this is a great phone to use while traveling abroad, if you're concerned about getting a 3G connection while your in Japan on vacation for example.","6","helpful"

"LG KP500 Cookie Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Digital Media Player--International Version (Black), No-Warranty","LG Electronics MobileComm USA","79","3","I, like many others who have written a review, chose this phone because it is very cheap for a touch screen. The first thing I like about the phone is that it is really, really, really light weight. It has a good solid feel to the palm and won't suffer that much cosmetic damage. The phone came with a screen protector so that was nice. I didn't want to spend more than a $100 dollars because all I do is text and call people. With that said, if you do not use internet or don't have a data plan, then this is an okay phone. If you do use a data plan, don't even think about buying this phone, it only uses the Edge network and not 3G. The phone came with a pre-installed firmware version 'KP500AT-V10F'. This firmware is pretty damn slow, so I had to flash the phone to the V10G_00 version. All the tutorials can be found on forums or youtube, just search it. With the new firmware, the texting is 10x better and overall speed in navigating through folders is much better as well. SO UPDATE THE FIRMWARE IF YOU GET THIS PHONE! In addition, a huge con is the amount of confirmation popups whenever you change something. For instance, trying to delete your text messages would follow this order: 'Delete selected?' ----> 'Deleting..."" ----> 'Deleted'. That is really annoying and unnecessary. The call quality is pretty good, and it's bluetooth ready. The camera is okay when there is a lot of light, if there is no light, the image quality is similar to the 'sepia' effect, yeah, its that bad. Overall, I am satisfied with this phone due to the call quality and price, but the biggest cons are definitely the initial firmware, the processing speed, and lackluster camera quality. As for music, it is loud, but who really uses their phone for an mp3 player. The phone also holds 500 total texts, 250 in inbox and outbox, more or less. All in all, if you don't want to be frustrated with the phone's speed, then update the firmware right when you get it.ALSO: THIS PHONE IS ABLE TO SEND AND RECEIVE MMS, DO NOT LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS! YOU HAVE TO CREATE NEW CONNECTION SETTINGS: INTERNET SETTINGS, MULTIMEDIA MSG CENTER SETTINGS, AND A NEW ACCESS POINT. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND ONLINE,JUST GOOGLE IT.","16","helpful"
"LG KP500 Cookie Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Digital Media Player--International Version (Black), No-Warranty","LG Electronics MobileComm USA","79","5","I've had this phone for about a month now, and I'm very impressed with it. It gets great reception, even better than my old V3 RAZR, which I thought had excellent reception. Call quality is also very good.I love the touchscreen! I won't go back to a non-touchscreen phone after this. It's so much easier to navigate through the menus and get it to do what I want. Yes, texting is a little more difficult. But, all the positives of the touchscreen outweigh that negative. And, I text quite a bit.I have At&T in the U.S. and I was able to get MMS and internet services to work right away. Just do a Google search for LG Cookie MMS settings AT&T. There is a lot of info out there on how to set it up.The phone is very thin and lightweight. I wear jeans a lot and it fits in the front pocket nicely.So, if you don't need 3G, GPS, or WiFi, this is a really great phone. If you do, then I'd look elsewhere. But, for me, it does everything I need, and does it well.","16","helpful"
"LG KP500 Cookie Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Digital Media Player--International Version (Black), No-Warranty","LG Electronics MobileComm USA","79","5","I've had the Cookie for about a month now and I am so happy with my purchase!It was fully charged when I received it and all the mentioned items were in the box, including the charger with adaptor. I slipped my SIM card in (I have T-Mobile Even More service) and it immediately recognized T-Mobile as the carrier; even shows it onscreen!Spent approximately 20 minutes playing around with the settings as they are organized a bit differently from U.S. phones...for instance, the settings for ring tones are under the ""Settings-Profile-Normal"" names, not the usual ones we see here. However, it's pretty easy and the touchpad appears to become more responsive with time as you get used to it.The QWERTY keyboard is great and the accelerometer function works quite well for typing with either [small] fingers or the stylus. People have received my texts promptly, as I have theirs. Anyone considering this phone would do well to check the services their provider offers - if you don't have an Internet plan, well, the phone won't surf the 'Net - I say this because I've seen a couple of complaints about that issue. I don't use my phone for that purpose, just calls and texting, and it's perfectly suited for such. Also, this is NOT a wi-fi or 3G equipped phone, which again suits my needs but perhaps not others...they'll have to spend a bit more for that and sacrifice battery life. Speaking of battery life, I am a fairly heavy talker and only charge my phone every 3-4 days - and it charges in less than a couple hours.All in all, if you're patient and like to fiddle with new gadgets as I do, you will LOVE this phone. The wallpapers, ringtones and games are really great and again, I'm extremely happy with my little Christmas present to myself!","22","helpful"

"Motorola Moto Q - Smartphone - CDMA2000 1X - bar - Windows Mobile - silver - Verizon","Motorola","18.5","2","I've had a Smartphone for about two years, so I'm not one of those people who didn't like the ""Q"" because I expected PocketPC features on it. I switched from Cingular to Verizon for service reasons, and the Q seemed like the closest phone to the Audiovox SMT-5600 that I had and liked. It was definitely wider, but thinner, which seemed like a reasonable tradeoff.In my opinion, it turned out not to be. The phone was really too big to carry in a pocket easily. Once I decided that I needed to carry it on my belt, I decided to get the XV6700 instead. It's a lot thicker, but it has a slide-out keyboard with much bigger keys, plus a stylus/touchscreen and the PocketPC features. I'm very happy with that choice. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't sell that phone for Verizon (though they have the Sprint version).Other things I disliked about the Q:- The keys are impossibly small. I used a small blackberry for a long time and was fine with it, but some combination of the size and the feel of the keys made it very hard to use.- There are no dedicated keys for phone use. The whole point of a smartphone is to be a great phone first. Dialing a number on the Q is just plain hard to do. Finding the * and # keys is even harder! Finally, if you need to find any letter equivalents of the number keys, you're out of luck unless you've memorized them all.Good luck with whatever you purchase.","20","helpful"

I have had this new phone for two weeks now and it has absolutely surpassed my expectations in every aspect.This phone is the international unlocked version of the current Motorola RAZR M, which is only carried by Verizon in the US. However, the Razr i works with GSM carriers (i.e. T-mobile and AT&T). Works with micro-SIM card. With T-mobile in the US, it runs on 3G when not on WiFi. Not sure about 4G yet, but definitely not 4G LTE compatible per Motorola specifications. I was a bit skeptical to purchase such an expensive unlocked product online and not really knowing for sure if it would have glitches or function properly in the US, but I'm so glad I took the risk.A few highlights/reviews on various features:CALLS: crystal clear reception on both ends and great speaker phone, even on the road. The rings tones are nice and pleasant.TEXTING: SWYPE feature may be enabled and disabled, but available. In any texting mode, very responsive keyboard. Even for the user who is not accustomed to a touch screen, it is super easy as the keys ""pop"" out on the screen and eliminate ""fat finger"" syndrome.CAMERA: HD-quality (back facing) and decent quality for (front facing - i.e. self portraits). Impressive and clear shots, and I dare say close to my brother's LG Optimus G, which has the highest photo quality on the market currently at 13MP. The video quality is pretty nice too. The camera feature is also well done in that it has its own ""quick access"" button on the lower right edge, so you don't have to ""dig"" to find it. Really nice for those spontaneous, unexpected photos ops, which of course always happen when one is not ready!QUALITY/BUILD: Corning Gorilla glass touch screen. Looks and feels durable.Does not feel flimsy by any means. Probably could get away without a case/back cover, but probably not a bad idea to have a screen protector to reduce smudges and fingerprints.FEEL: one of the few ""one-handed"" devices out there. Nice and thin, probably more comparable to the iPhone 4, in terms of overall size.APPS: Does not come with an overwhelming number of Apps, which is nice because you can build up your Apps list and customize from scratch.ALARMS: It has as many options as you need, which is nice for varying workdays and weekends. Also, overall pleasant alarm sounds, which is nice. (But that is coming from the Blackberry, so my perception is skewed and anything really sounds better having said that.)BATTERY LIFE: Fairly decent. This was very important to me, personally, and not many IT reviews focused too much on this so I'll go into more detail for those interested. Today, for example, I spoke on the phone for 1.5 hours total, played Pandora for about 2 hours, sent and received about 15 texts (some days up to 30-40), read about 10 emails, replied to 3 emails, and checked FB about three times...and the battery life is now about 40% left in the 12 hours of usage. You can always install an Android ""App Killer"" that terminates various Apps periodically that run in the background to optimize your battery life. Also, the product comes with a US wall plug, which the USB cord plugs into; that's nice since you can also go between wall or your laptop/PC to charge. Also, the phone is sent with a UK plug/adapter as well (also USB compatible), so that's handy for a trip abroad.In conclusion, if you're looking for a durable, high-quality, practical phone, and you're disappointed because GSM providers here in the US don't carry the Motorola Razr devices, then this is the perfect workaround solution! I absolutely adore this phone, best choice for me. Thanks for reading, hope this helps a bit.UPDATE: August 18, 2013Still very pleased with this phone! I installed Dropbox the other day, and used it to edit some documents in QuickOffice. Amazing! Just very responsive and fast! I haven't found a flaw with it yet, and I've used it for two months now.","20","helpful"

Nice and thin, probably more comparable to the iPhone 4, in terms of overall size.APPS: Does not come with an overwhelming number of Apps, which is nice because you can build up your Apps list and customize from scratch.ALARMS: It has as many options as you need, which is nice for varying workdays and weekends. Also, overall pleasant alarm sounds, which is nice. (But that is coming from the Blackberry, so my perception is skewed and anything really sounds better having said that.)BATTERY LIFE: Fairly decent. This was very important to me, personally, and not many IT reviews focused too much on this so I'll go into more detail for those interested. Today, for example, I spoke on the phone for 1.5 hours total, played Pandora for about 2 hours, sent and received about 15 texts (some days up to 30-40), read about 10 emails, replied to 3 emails, and checked FB about three times...and the battery life is now about 40% left in the 12 hours of usage. You can always install an Android ""App Killer"" that terminates various Apps periodically that run in the background to optimize your battery life. Also, the product comes with a US wall plug, which the USB cord plugs into; that's nice since you can also go between wall or your laptop/PC to charge. Also, the phone is sent with a UK plug/adapter as well (also USB compatible), so that's handy for a trip abroad.In conclusion, if you're looking for a durable, high-quality, practical phone, and you're disappointed because GSM providers here in the US don't carry the Motorola Razr devices, then this is the perfect workaround solution! I absolutely adore this phone, best choice for me. Thanks for reading, hope this helps a bit.UPDATE: August 18, 2013Still very pleased with this phone! I installed Dropbox the other day, and used it to edit some documents in QuickOffice. Amazing! Just very responsive and fast! I haven't found a flaw with it yet, and I've used it for two months now.","20","helpful"
"Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads","Motorola","149.99","5","Right up front, I'm a huge fan of Motorola phones. I've owned several throughout the years, along with LG, Samsung, and Blackberry. Motos will always be my favorite. Having only had the phone a few weeks now, I won't overly elaborate here. I wondered with Lenovo taking over Motorola if it would lose some of the quality I've always expected, but I can happily say it has not. Sound quality is superb, phone is just the right size for me (thin and slender), the screen is beautiful and bright, and the processor is fast enough for what I do. Email, messaging, texting, accessing my Google Drive and Photos, phone calls, and a small amount of games. The camera is completely on par with my previous Samsung, which I'm happy about. The camera isn't great, but not being willing to pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars for a cell phone, it's more than fine for me. My only issue with the phone is that the on/off button and volume button are right where I usually hold my phone, so I'm prone to turn off the screen or change the volume. But that's as much do to my having small hands as a flaw in the phone. It's certainly not a deal breaker. Another issue, this time not with the phone, is Motorola's website. It's impossible to navigate, so when I need help I normally just call customer support. They're professional and always courteous and helpful.Now for the Amazon Prime Exclusive ""bloatware"" and ads which have been so blown out of proportion. There's an ad on the lockscreen. Who spends time looking at their lockscreen? I surely don't. And sometimes I get a small notification in the notification bar along with a text message. That's it. Seriously. After two weeks, I don't even notice them, although every so often an ad will pop up for something I really want to check out. The Amazon apps on the phone are things I use anyway, being a Prime Member. I've loaded some of them on other phones I've had, so I fail to see the problem. Bottom line, if you're a Prime Member and use Amazon a lot, don't let any of this deter you.The phone is a wonderful bargain, the Amazon Prime Exclusive is well worth the $50 saved.","21","helpful"

"Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads","Motorola","149.99","5","I think that it is so because as with some other things we can find now, it was designed to give full capabilities, ruggedness, and long life to persons in non-first-world countries. Thus the replaceable battery, the full set of bands and great performance of Motorola's most up-to-date designs, and even the size, which is comfortable and large enough.I've found performance to be excellent, all around an area which used to be somewhat fringe on a good Sony feature phone. The 4G is flawless with T-Mobile, when I want to pay for data by an add-on pass to my $3/mo pay-as-go plan, and it's fast -- twice my cable internet.Running on wifi, I'm surprised to find that even watching a film is satisfying, and the sound with good earbuds is rich.Calls and receiving calls and SMS can be entirely free on wifi, not using your minutes, if you are careful to understand setting up Google Voice and Dialer. Just be sure to understand that you don't want forwarding to the phone when using this mode of Google services, or they would go on your plan minutes.. Get someone to help if the web instructions seem hard.The bonus is that this phone integrates wifi or 4g-data calling via Google seamlessly, so that you use your phone in the slick way Motorola has arranged it - just one extra tap as you make a call, to choose Google or your cell provider.The Marshmallow level of Android is very well developed and smooth with Motorola's no-interference way of providing it -- plus the Google services you can add offer quite a lot, even including what seem to offer just as much by now as Siri. You can voice-type effectively, and there is swipe typing, a big advance on fingers or thumbs, if those are well provided for also. You can ask for Google lookups in a moment, then return to the note you were writing or the call you are on. You can ask to make appointments. where to find a laundromat or a meal, and so forth., and it all actually works.I'd have to say that as an actual old hand on what goes into these things, I feel a real sense of using something already travelling into a future.The ads -- actually, the Amazon ads are so far almost always tasteful, I know because I made an effort to look. If you have notifications, you are only going to see those ads as the same small notes,, very unobtrusive. I find the cacophony of other ads all through using some apps to be the real issue, and those have nothing to do with Amazon. The answer to them is to choose your apps from those which are tasteful about this, and that is something you can easily do.Your choice, then. If you're not intent on spinning around with Pokemon, or playing reflex-demanding games, you might also find this quite a valuable bargain. I would suggest trying one out in a store, to see about the size, and then you can also learn about the smoothness. Style too, as this is always personal.","23","helpful"
"Motorola Atrix HD 8GB MB886 4G LTE Black - AT&T Wireless","Motorola","52.46","5","I was pretty eager to get out of my increasingly expensive contract with Verizon. It took me awhile to make the leap because I have a strong preference for physical keyboards. Typos bug me and they're a lot harder to avoid when using a virtual keyboard (I think most people would agree). Unfortunately, Verizon seems to have the best selection of Androids with keyboards. I wanted a phone that stood a fighting chance of getting an official OS update at some point. Most of the sliders I saw on other carriers had processors that would not be able to support the newer operating systems (4.0 and up). I eventually resigned myself to the fact that I would have to get used to a virtual keyboard if I wanted to save some money. A little background: I was with Verizon for 5 years. I loved their service, but I couldn't justify spending so much money every month for service that I could probably get elsewhere for much less. I love to tinker and I'm technically-proficient, which led me to seek out avenues that a lot of people won't bother with. A little over a year before I bought the Atrix, I bought an iPhone 4s and set it up so that it could be used on an AT&T GoPhone plan. It worked out very well, with AT&T service proving to be just as reliable as what I had with Verizon (I'm near Buffalo, NY, for what it's worth). I accepted that I would not be able to find a slider that fit my specifications and looked around for an AT&T phone or something unlocked that I could use on AT&T. I eventually narrowed it down to the HTC One X or the Atrix HD. It ended up being an easy decision: I didn't want a 16GB phone that I couldn't slip a memory card into, as I'd rather have my files backed up to something I have in my possession versus having them saved to the cloud. That was the clincher for me. I appreciated the Atrix HD's relatively low price tag, considering its specs. It came with ICS, which is not yet necessarily a given with newer phones. It has a 1.5GHZ processor, which means it has the processing power for at least one more official OS update. Most of the sliders I researched had sub-1GHZ processors, which pretty much rules out the possibility of an official ICS update (the official OS requires about a 1GHZ processor to run). It has ample internal memory, but that's to be expected from most new phones that are made for post-paid use. It is a 4G phone, but I don't use the 4G (more on that later). It doesn't have NFC and, as a Motorola device, I get the feeling it will be awhile before it gets a Jellybean update, but it really isn't lacking anything that most people would expect from a newer Android phone. It does have its faults, but they're offset by its pros and price. The off-contract price for me was just over $400, including shipping and tax. My iPhone cost over $800 off-contract. I will note that I don't care for the camera, but I've yet to like any camera other than the one on my 4s. I've yet to use an 8MP camera on an Android device that doesn't disappoint. That said, the pictures are usually not hideous and using CamScanner to take tidier pictures is a workable solution for me. I'm also sort of down on the battery life, but the great-looking screen is the culprit and I know it. I rooted my phone and used RootDim to take it down a few extra notches, but the impact on battery life has not been apparent. I've owned two of these phones, as the first unit was seemingly defective. I've used and fixed many phones, but I couldn't find a permanent fix for the first unit's misbehavior. It had a tendency to bootloop every few days, something I was always able to correct by connecting my phone to ADB on my computer and running logcats to pinpoint operational errors. Doing that is far from a 10-minute process and it became obvious to me that I was finding temporary fixes for a permanent problem. The phone would usually drop its wifi connection before beginning to bootloop so I had a feeling that nothing could fix that particular device. I emailed the seller (Wireless Experts, Inc.), explained my problem and that I was probably going to return the device for another one when I was done troubleshooting. They were great about it, even offering to extend the return period for me so I could finish trying to solve the problem. Ultimately, I exchanged the phone for another Atrix HD and that one is working just as it should. I definitely have to endorse Wireless Experts, Inc. for the way they handled my problem. About 4G: I use this phone on a GoPhone plan and GoPhone does not support 4G as of right now (11/12). I have the 4G icon on my phone, but that's because AT&T sort of renamed its 3G network-haha. I don't know how well it would perform or how the battery life would be impacted by 4G. What I can say for sure is that this phone is a bargain for my monthly fee of $45. I was paying about $120 for my Droid 3 on Verizon and this phone is a much better performer, with a much better (non-Pentile) display. It was a serious upgrade for me and it's a bargain as I'm using it, considering that I had enough disposable income at the time of purchase. Great phone. Modern features (for November 2012). I'd recommend this phone and my seller to anyone who's on the market for a new phone.","23","helpful"

"Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Phone with Dual-Band GSM 850/1900--International Version with No Warranty (Black)","Motorola","63.28","5","I discovered this phone's existence online. Once again, thanks to Amazon's unparalleled customer review knowledge base, I got the skinny and knew what I was in for. I wanted a phone with a screen that was READABLE. Due to limitations in technology (LCD) and biology (my need for reading glasses), the screen of my little Nokia is only visible when cupped in my hands in a darkened theater. And even that low-budget phone has too much JUNK to wade through. (I don't care to do Internet shopping by phone, thanks though) The Motofone F3 does what a phone is supposed to do - it lets you TALK to people quickly and easily. It's Electronic Ink screen is amazing - you REALLY CAN read it in broad daylight. Why isn't any other phone using this technology?If you're interested, please do read the reviews. These phones are not marketed in the USA it seems - I guess we are collectively just too hip and sophisticated for this quaint little thing. Mine came ""unlocked"" as advertised - I just transplanted the SIM card from my old phone and I was ready to go. You have to choose your preferred language, and if you want a manual for the dozen or less functions, you can download it easily from Motorola.Some of the negative reviews are gut-busters. Did these folks even READ about the phone they were getting? Maybe it was a gift, I don't know. ""Box was opened!""? That's because they're pulling these from South America or India and unlocking them for you! ""Has a crappy interface!""? It does look like Etch a Sketch, but hey, I don't care to have all my friends' avatars on my screen. I can speed dial about 15 numbers. And you CAN send and receive text, if'n you really have to, though I don't think I ever will. (So counterintuitive... that's why God invented keyboards!) ""Phone has no color screen! / no MP3 player! / no camera!"" etc... Well, if that's what you want, you don't want this phone. I told all my higher-tech friends that I just got two ""Third World Phones"" - and my wife and I love them.Note: apparently some folks did not get ""unlocked"" phones or had other technical problems. I was lucky in that regard. (May have been a different vender.) Also make sure your phone plan uses compatible technology. Amazon has a little chart at the top of the page to help you with this too.

I wanted an upgrade and selected the RAZR V3. The first phone delivered did not live up to RAZR standards. I contacted the company and worked with Erin, their rep. I exchanged the phone at no cost to me. The new phone has excellent reception, I do not have to use the speaker for people to hear me (this was my main problem with the old phone). I also had a phone book problem which was corrected by the exchange.My suggestion to anyone who wants an inexpensive phone is to try this one. If it does not work out for you, call the company and give them a chance to fix the problem. If you would rather return the phone you will be offered a full refund. The choice was mine and I gave them a second chance. They made things right.","23","helpful"
"Moto Z Unlocked Smartphone, 5.5"" Quad HD screen, 64GB storage, 5.2mm thin - Lunar Grey - 64GB (U.S. Warranty)","Motorola","699.99","3","Dangit Lenovo. My elderly XT1053 first generation MotoX died about a year ago and I have been eagerly awaiting the MotoZ. I've been using an iPhone 6 for that year. It hasn't been the worst year of my life. That award goes to the year I caught my incestuous ex-wife with her obese cousin.What sucks about the MotoZ? Read on:* It is simply too big. After a Bowie-knife, a roll of duct-tape and a wallet stuffed with partially filled free-sandwich cards, I really don't have room in my pockets for the paper-back book this phone attempts to be.* The camera is somehow always blurry. This is great for pictures of my deep-Appalachian family, but not so useful for insurance-shots of deer, bears and other wild animals that break into my house and steal my electronics and gold-bars.* The ""wood-style-back"" is, well... very roughly 'styled' after wood. A wood that shows oily fingerprints and feels like cheap plastic. My original MotoX had real wood backing. Somehow I missed that ""wood-style"" means ""not wood anymore"". I admit, I researched weakly.If you want big, you want fake, and you want a camera that would make a Shar-Pei dog's face look unwrinkled, look no further.","24","helpful"

I couldn't turn the phone on until I found the RIGHT manual on line.Could not get it activated because it had already been activated and the phone was useless.

"Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","Motorola","82","5","I bought this for my teenage daughter along with a 16gb sd card for $20.So for well under $100 she has a decent first smartphone.She uses it to read books on the Kindle app,she downloaded a mp3 type app and now downloads and listens to music via headphones(constantly:-))goes on facebook,take photos and videos,texts and calls of course and play a couple games she likes.So she's not a heavy user like her dad.This phone wont handle too many running widgets but it does play games good,run live wallpapers if you're into that and search the web okay.It has a 4 row qwerty (the top row has the numbers as well as the qwerty row) a removable battery (why manufacturers are making them these days without a keyboard or interchangeable batteries is beyond me) and a flash foe the camera and digital recorder.It's not a bad phone at all for the price just don't put too much strain on it,one task at a time and it works and looks good.For the price I definitely recommend it,just know that it doesn't come close to the phones coming out today as far as power.But the phones coming out today will be the same way in a couple years,they basically get 'old' in roughly 6 months so you have to watch what software you downloadIt does basically the same things as brand new phones just not as fast.Google Maps,no problem,Google searches also no problem.A decent phone especially for a first smartphone.I'm telling you,my daughter is very happy with it and that's what I wanted.I guess she can multi task with it with some things cause after she gets done with her homework more often than not she can be found with her headphones on listening to her music app while also reading from her Kindle app.I honestly don't know why there's so many negative reviews,I have a new and powerful smartphone and her Droid 2 will literally do almost everything mine does.The Droid 2 just can't run as many things at once as my phone but if they're done one at a time there's no problems.It can do basically everything and do it for a quarter the price.I haven't checked current prices but I bought my daughters Droid 2 a couple months ago via Amazon for $64.99 then got her a bigger sd card than mine also via Amazon for half what I paid for mine out of the store.So her Droid 2 can actually store a lot more info than my new phone can because she has a 16gb card and I have an 8gb.If you're new to these phones and not familiar with digital storage even 8gb is a lot.With an 8gb sd card combined with my phones internal memory I've downloaded over 250 apps not including what comes preinstalled,I've taken over 750 photos that are still stored in my phone,over an hour of video and lots of other stuff and I still have memory left.Also,if this is your first smartphone you'll probably be like most everybody else and get lots of cool apps,some of them cost money but once you buy them they're always yours even if you switch phones.Just sign up your new phone with the same email address and you can put all your paid apps on your new phone without paying again.I was so relieved when I found that out:-)I hope that helps,the Droid 2 is a really good phone for what they're asking here.I would recommend getting an extra charger for your car,they're like $3 here on Amazon,and also get a good protective cover.They make todays phone very fragile on purpose I imagine so we're forced to buy new ones in the event we drop them one too many times.My first cell phone I had back in the 90's was made like a brick,I could have literally dropped it off a roof and it would have been okay.You don't want to hop out of your car with your phone in your lap with today's phones,that's how I broke my last one:-)Droid 2 is a great starter smartphone in my opinion.","24","helpful"

"Moto Z Play - Black - 32GB (U.S. Warranty)","Motorola","449.99","5","Pre-ordered and get it today (Oct 20). I was a Samsung s7 user.First feel:1. There is a wooden case come with the order, which I assume is a gift for pre-orders. I bought a Nylon case on Moto's website and personally prefer that feeling. However, there is a little bit shake between the case and the phone. Normally you would not notice it, but if you are an OCD like me just don't case.2. There is nothing to complain about the smooth. Snapdragon 625 is good enough for daily use (thanks for 14nm I guess), and I didn't feel heat at all (compared to my Snapdragon 820 S7). And I don't play games.3. Battery seems to be perfect. Will add more details later.Drawbacks:Type-C ! At first I think it is an advantage, but turns out it's a nightmare. The original package contains a charger and cable combo, which means you have to buy a new Type-C cable yourself in order to make data transfer (and I'm an android auto user). The cable is not on Moto's website and you have to find one on amazon. However, you have to choose carefully! Not all type-c cables will work for this phone, only the ones in good qualities will. I used to have two type-c cables for my type-c mobile battery, which are all not working for the phone.May add more in future.","26","helpful"

"Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty","Motorola","249","5","Having previously owned an LG G4 ($450), I will try not to be too harsh on LenovoΓÇÖs Moto G4 Plus (64GB), which costs a full $150 less with double the storage and an extra 1GB of RAM.Camera:I have found the rear camera is slightly better than that of a Galaxy S4. The LG G4 had far and away a better camera (featuring OIS), but for the price, the Moto G4 camera is satisfactory. You must hold the device very still or the picture may come out blurry in anything besides broad daylight. Daylight pictures are good, but dark blacks seem to get muddled together. Nothing toying with the brightness and contrast won't fix.Performance:Could not ask for better for the price. I use my phone for texting, music, calling, videos, and web browsing and the Moto G4 Plus has delivered responsive, liquid smooth performance. Stutter is introduced when scrolling heavy webpages, but I have yet to not experience this on a mobile device. The 4GB of RAM definitely makes a difference while multitasking.Sound:Audio via Bluetooth and the headphone jack is on par with that of my other smartphones, if not better. Bluetooth connects very quickly. The headphone jack makes electrical sounds when inserting a plug, so donΓÇÖt let that startle you. I really like the front-facing speaker, calls are loud and clear. It does distort with some loud ringtones, but I have yet to encounter any distortion with playing music.Headphones are not included with the G4 Plus.Display:The 1080p 5.5ΓÇ¥ display is great. I will always miss AMOLED, but the Moto G4ΓÇÖs TFT LCD rivals the LG G4ΓÇÖs QHD IPS LCD display in every aspect except pixel density.Touch is very responsive and accurate.Heating Issue:I have not used the camera for long periods of time (more than 2 minutes), but so far, I have not experienced any issue with heat. The only time I have experienced any heat from the phone is when I had the screen on for hours while downloading apps and charging at the same time, and even then it was not uncomfortably hot, just warm.Other Hardware:The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick and accurate and the physical buttons feel very good. I would expect them to be found on a $700 device.Overall build quality is great for the price, it feels more solid than the LG G4.While not curved like the LG G4, it sits well in the hand and does not feel too huge in the pocket.After allowing the battery life to settle in, I can make it a whole day without going below 50%, which is excellent.Other Software:Marshmallow is very slick and packed full of neat animations and features. While not 100% vanilla, this version of Android is very close, providing a familiar experience. I find myself amazed at how far every version of Android has come since the days of Gingerbread.There are not many tweaks available out of the box, cosmetic or otherwise. You canΓÇÖt even change/add/move the softkeys, which is disappointing.Rooting looks intimidating with this device, but once you think through it, it is actually incredibly quick and easy depending on which method you use.Xposed needs to be manually flashed (I have v85 working), and GravityBox provides many useful tweaks which seem to be working so far. I am also using Nova Launcher to gain some more launcher features. Having used Cyanogenmod in the past, IΓÇÖm satisfied with just GravityBox and Nova on this device.FoxFiΓÇÖs wifi hotspot crashes the device, but USB tethering works just fine (make sure you are in MTP or PDANet Desktop will show an unhelpful error).One annoying ΓÇ£featureΓÇ¥ is that the G4 Plus always connects to any PC in ΓÇ£chargingΓÇ¥ mode, not MTP. I have to manually switch to MTP every time. Hopefully there is a way to make MTP the default, but I havenΓÇÖt found it yet.After a week of use, I am really enjoying this device. I have a hard time believing this phone was only $299. It blows my $450 LG G4 away in nearly every respect except camera quality.","28","helpful"

"Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Phone with Dual-Band GSM 850/1900--International Version with No Warranty (Black)","Motorola","63.28","4","I bought this on a whim. My dad's cell phone has a big crack in the screen so I figured I would upgrade him into something new. He's not a big gadget guy so there was no need for features like a camera or bluetooth or even a color screen for that matter.When I received the box I was a little shocked. First thing I noticed is the manual was in Spanish. This wasn't a big deal to me. I searched the web and found an English manual to download. This could really annoy others expecting a better out of box experience. The next thing that caught me off guard was the default language; it was also Spanish. Again, no biggie because the phone ""speaks"" to you when you power it up and asks you what language you want to select. Pressing ""3"" sets the language to English and you're set.Once powered on you can choose to keep the phone in ""Voice Guidance"" mode. This is actually a really user-friendly feature. After you push the Menu button (located to the left of the navigation pad) you can navigate through menu items with the pad and the voice tells you what menu item you are on. This totally makes up for the B/W screen and lackluster icons.Overall this is a great entry-level or emergency phone. The call quality rivals any phone I've used. Volume was loud and clarity was near-perfect.Pros:- Great signal strength- Crystal clear calling- Solid battery life- Slim profile looks more sophisticated than it really is- Speakerphone (press Menu button twice when on a call)- Voice guidanceCons:- Spanish manual and default language- Low-res, monochrome LCD screen (See customer images)- No modern bells or whistles- Kinda plasticky feeling- Not for TextersFor the price (Sub-$40) this can't be beat. Just make sure you know what you are getting into before you buy it.Only 4-stars due to the whole Spanish manual/language thing.","141","helpful"
"Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads","Motorola","149.99","3","I like this phone! I like the size, clarity, speed, ease of use, and even the 8MP camera does a fairly good job. Hopefully I can say all the same things in a few months, time will tell. The Amazon offers/ads on the lockscreen are inconspicuous and not a problem at all, once you access the phone the ads are gone, that's $50 well saved IMO! As soon as my Moto Play arrived I switched the SIM card from my Consumer Cellular purchased Moto G 1st Gen to the Moto Play. I also added a 16 GB SD card for a bit of a kick (I probably won't even need it). I fired it up and followed the prompts. My Google contacts loaded quickly, I also used Motorola's ""Migrate"", everything transferred smooth as silk. After making sure everything worked I contacted Consumer Cellular to let them know I had upgraded phones. The only thing the service rep needed was the phone's IMEI #. She also wanted me to check and make sure I could access the Net without using Wi-Fi, I did this without a problem and that was that, I was good to go. I know what the Moto Play is and isn't capable of as I've researched extensively. I've compared all the specs and capabilities of other phones at various price levels and decided the price of $99 for this phone was the absolute best bang for the buck for me. I haven't deluded myself into thinking this is the best of the best, I realize the Moto Play does not have all the bells and whistles that some other phones offer but after checking prices of similar unlocked phones I'm more than satisfied with my purchase. The important thing to me is, this phone fits my needs, it offers no more nor no less of what I need in a phone. In regards to going in-depth concerning the detailed specs of the Moto Play there's no need for me to cover ground already covered since other reviewers have already given excellent reviews on the specs, pros, and cons of the Moto Play.UPDATE; 9/24I've dropped my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because my Moto Play gets warm during talk use of no more than 10 minutes (CPU temps reaching 115-125). The phone also gets warm while surfing or using FM radio or YouTube after a few minutes. I never had this problem with my Moto G 1st gen while doing the same things but maybe this is normal because of a more powerful battery. I've read of this problem in several Moto G 4 reviews but no one has mentioned this in Moto Play reviews. If anyone knows if this is normal or has experienced the same problem with CPU temps reaching 115-125 on their Moto Play please reply, thanks!UPDATE; 10/10/16As stated in my original post I purchased a 16 GB SD card for my MOTO PLAY. The card I purchased was a SanDisc hi-speed class 10 Micro SD card especially designed for the MOTO PLAY. I've read complaints in other reviews that the larger MOTO 4 loses connection with SD cards occasionally and have to be re-inserted. I've experienced the same problem and after having to re-insert 4 times because of lost connection I'm lowering my original 5 star rating to a 3 star rating. In every other respect (other than the phone running warm) there's still an awful lot I like about the Moto Play but I've come to realize it has it's faults but for the cost of $99 I can live with those faults. BTW, I've removed the SD card and will make do without it.","153","helpful"
"Motorola RAZR V3 Black (AT&T)","Motorola","21.11","5","First and foremost what I look for in a cell phone is functionality. In that I mean its abilities to make and recieve calls.I've read that this Razr recieved the most sophisticated antenna ever put into a Moto phone. I believe that hands down. I rarely lose a signal and calls sound near perfect most of the time.The camera is good, not great, but good. Much, much better than my old Sanyo SCP-8100 (Sprint). The digital zoom works flawlessly and leaves no pixelation when zoomed (a common problem with dig. zooms) very clear. A friends Sanyo SCH-a670 leaves great pixelation when zoomed. Better software in the Moto I assume.Speaking of software I highly recommend the Moto Phone Tools 3.0! I bought this with my Razr because I knew I wanted to pimp my phone to the max. It works awesome! All those MP3 ringtones I use to Download for $3 a pop - gone. I make my own wallpapers and MP3 ringtones now. For free. Plus when you plug the phone to your USB port on your PC it also acts as a charger! Charging the battery as you load media onto your cell.The bluetooth works flawlessly as well. I bought the Motorola HS850 headset. The calls are crystal clear. You could answer and make calls while never opening your phone. The voice dialing works superbly on the Razr.This is a quad (4) band GSM world phone. You could go to Japan and use this thing.*EDIT* this phone STILL works awesomely. It has been handed down to another family member and then rehanded down to another family member. It continues to be a true Die-Hard! Like the Toyota of cell's - but without the sticky throttle thing. :PThis Razr could also be used as a modem to connect you laptop or desktop to the internet. Anywhere theres a GSM signal. A nice feature I thought. Especially for gadget freaks.The internal color screen is the best I've ever seen on a phone to this date. No kidding. Bright and vibrant. Some of my wallpapers seem to be 3-D.The phone is very thin and light. When opened it fits naturally to your face. Just the right size.

"Motorola Moto E (1st Generation) - Black - 4 GB - Global GSM Unlocked Phone","Motorola","109.99","5","This wonderful unlocked Moto E Phone I am delighted with as for the low price that I paid, it has far surpassed my expectations in a smartphone! Since I own a HUGE five inch Samsung Galaxy Grand, this phone I find just perfect for travel and it is so easy to hold due to the curved back. For you the reader, my goal here is to give you everyday and practical uses regarding this phone.PROS:+ Battery Life - Simply AMAZING - the absolute best battery life of any smartphone or tablet that I have owned! Since this phone does NOT come with lots of bloatware and useless apps, this helps the memory to run better and the battery last longer! In fact, I have gotten a day and a half of battery use (I turn off WiFi when I am off the internet or email etc). However, I run my brightness at 100%. So on an average day, I get at least a full day with about 20 percent left (sometimes more) and then I charge it overnight. *The very long battery life is what sold me on this phone. Too many times in the past with phones that have too many bells and whistles, the battery ran out so quickly. However, this phone lasts me all day until I go to bed when it goes back on it's charger!+ Built in slip proof anti slip (bumper) cover - In a sense, the slip proof cover is built into the phone and it so attractive and anti slip on the front and on the back, that I did not need to purchase an additional cover to start using the phone. However, I have my eye on a book style cover for this phone already!The back of this phone removes you you can change the color of the back part to a different color etc.+ Screen Resolution - AMAZING! The colors are vivid and the fonts, icons are very clear. Even though this is a smaller phone at 4.3 inch screen, when I view pages on the internet, the text is clear and pictures very clear and colorful!And the screen is so clear that I can read PDF books using Adobe Reader and see the pages without my glasses!+ KitKat / Pure Android Experience - Since this has the pure Android with no overlays over it, and just the essential apps installed, this is a leaner phone that uses much less memory and battery than the ones that have those overlays and are not straight Android! This means that KitKat OS runs better and faster also I have found. I know as I own two Samsung tablets with KitKat that I love, but they have bloatware on them, this phone does not). It received the Kit Kat update to 4.4.3 soon after I purchased this phone so it is very up to date and running very smoothly.+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - The strongest WiFi yet of any phone that I have owned, and I really am serious! This phone has Very, very fast connect and it keeps the connect. In fact in the back of my home (the furthest from my router), I still get 4.5 bars of WiFi signal on this phone! This I tested using my home router and on the go at many hotspots with WiFi. Other hotspots: No problems at all connecting and staying connected on these. And I found the speed still high at home with several devices connected at the same time to the router, and there is no loss in speed.+ External SD Card Information - Since this phone has an external SD slot, I installed my 32GB SanDisk Micro Class 4 Micro SD card and it installed and has worked just fine on this Moto phone. Note that some people who own 32GB or higher SD cards with Class 10 have had their phones sometimes give them error message: SD Card unexpectedly removed. This is NOT the fault of the phone. As I have researched this extensively, my findings have stated that it because a smartphone or tablet reads a class 4 or Class 6 card better. However, just some people have this problem with a class 10 card, but for me, I stick with the class 4 SD card and have never encountered this problem on this phone or on any phone or tablet that I have used.+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The Chrome browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser with great internet viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me.+ Office Program with the phone - Found it to be OK, but I went to the Playstore and installed Docs to Go (which lets me edit, save, view in MS Office types and also view PDF files). There is also a MS Office App (free) in the Playstore.+ Music Player - This phone comes with Google Player installed and I like it OK. It does play music that is stored on my external SD card nicely and saves new Playlists OK (and Google Player also plays music from the Cloud). However, let me suggest Rocket Music Player (free) from the Playstore. I like it because my music is on my external SD card and it plays it in playlists or from my folders etc. I have already created my playlists on it and the sound from this player is superb!+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.+ Peppy and fast - Found the response on this phone to be very peppy and fast, no lagging ever!CONS:- The new Adobe Flash is not supported, however, I found that archived flash (which I installed) gets some online videos to play. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos (I use Maxthon Browser and have had good results, however, I could not get Amazon videos to play).- No flash on the 5MP Camera. This is a lower end camera, I suggest that you use your regular camera for the best picture taking situations. However, to test this camera, I took several outdoor shots as well as a few indoor shots (in bright lighting) and to my amazement, the pictures looked OK, and good enough to email and keep, yet I will be taking my regular digital camera for more serious camera shots.-- Somewhat Low internal storage (but not a problem). The good news is that if an App has KitKat standard and it is newer updated app, then it can be move onto the External SD Card. I was able to move more than half of my installed apps so I still have 1.5GB left on my internal space!- No NFC and NO OTG - This phone will not work with an OTG Adapter with flash drive and other USB devices. This is not a problem as I use Dropbox for sending pictures, etc. No NFC (Near Field Communication) - I do not use this so this is not a problem for me.Bottom line: Would I buy this Moto E phone over again? Yes, I certainly would buy this phone again because it is easy to use, SUPERB battery life, as well as simple to operate. If you are looking for a easy to use and low cost Android smartphone that has really great battery life, let me suggest this phone to you. Also, since I am a techie person, I will be happy to answer any questions you may have through the comment section.","287","helpful"
"Motorola Moto E (1st Generation) - Black - 4 GB - US GSM Unlocked Phone","Motorola","89.99","5","This wonderful unlocked Moto E Phone I am delighted with as for the low price that I paid, it has far surpassed my expectations in a smartphone! Since I own a HUGE five inch Samsung Galaxy Grand, this phone I find just perfect for travel and it is so easy to hold due to the curved back. For you the reader, my goal here is to give you everyday and practical uses regarding this phone.PROS:+ Battery Life - Simply AMAZING - the absolute best battery life of any smartphone or tablet that I have owned! Since this phone does NOT come with lots of bloatware and useless apps, this helps the memory to run better and the battery last longer! In fact, I have gotten a day and a half of battery use (I turn off WiFi when I am off the internet or email etc). However, I run my brightness at 100%. So on an average day, I get at least a full day with about 20 percent left (sometimes more) and then I charge it overnight. *The very long battery life is what sold me on this phone. Too many times in the past with phones that have too many bells and whistles, the battery ran out so quickly. However, this phone lasts me all day until I go to bed when it goes back on it's charger!+ Built in slip proof anti slip (bumper) cover - In a sense, the slip proof cover is built into the phone and it so attractive and anti slip on the front and on the back, that I did not need to purchase an additional cover to start using the phone. However, I have my eye on a book style cover for this phone already!The back of this phone removes you you can change the color of the back part to a different color etc.+ Screen Resolution - AMAZING! The colors are vivid and the fonts, icons are very clear. Even though this is a smaller phone at 4.3 inch screen, when I view pages on the internet, the text is clear and pictures very clear and colorful!And the screen is so clear that I can read PDF books using Adobe Reader and see the pages without my glasses!+ KitKat / Pure Android Experience - Since this has the pure Android with no overlays over it, and just the essential apps installed, this is a leaner phone that uses much less memory and battery than the ones that have those overlays and are not straight Android! This means that KitKat OS runs better and faster also I have found. I know as I own two Samsung tablets with KitKat that I love, but they have bloatware on them, this phone does not). It received the Kit Kat update to 4.4.3 soon after I purchased this phone so it is very up to date and running very smoothly.+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - The strongest WiFi yet of any phone that I have owned, and I really am serious! This phone has Very, very fast connect and it keeps the connect. In fact in the back of my home (the furthest from my router), I still get 4.5 bars of WiFi signal on this phone! This I tested using my home router and on the go at many hotspots with WiFi. Other hotspots: No problems at all connecting and staying connected on these. And I found the speed still high at home with several devices connected at the same time to the router, and there is no loss in speed.+ External SD Card Information - Since this phone has an external SD slot, I installed my 32GB SanDisk Micro Class 4 Micro SD card and it installed and has worked just fine on this Moto phone. Note that some people who own 32GB or higher SD cards with Class 10 have had their phones sometimes give them error message: SD Card unexpectedly removed. This is NOT the fault of the phone. As I have researched this extensively, my findings have stated that it because a smartphone or tablet reads a class 4 or Class 6 card better. However, just some people have this problem with a class 10 card, but for me, I stick with the class 4 SD card and have never encountered this problem on this phone or on any phone or tablet that I have used.+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The Chrome browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser with great internet viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me.+ Office Program with the phone - Found it to be OK, but I went to the Playstore and installed Docs to Go (which lets me edit, save, view in MS Office types and also view PDF files). There is also a MS Office App (free) in the Playstore.+ Music Player - This phone comes with Google Player installed and I like it OK. It does play music that is stored on my external SD card nicely and saves new Playlists OK (and Google Player also plays music from the Cloud). However, let me suggest Rocket Music Player (free) from the Playstore. I like it because my music is on my external SD card and it plays it in playlists or from my folders etc. I have already created my playlists on it and the sound from this player is superb!+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.+ Peppy and fast - Found the response on this phone to be very peppy and fast, no lagging ever!CONS:- The new Adobe Flash is not supported, however, I found that archived flash (which I installed) gets some online videos to play.

"Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty","Motorola","249","5","MOTO G (4th Gen) Plus - 64gb version. (My old phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note 4).2 Week Update.Screen: The resolution is excellent. It is full HD and compares well to my Note 4. I played with a Note 5 over the 4th and the screen resolution of that is the same. Yes the Notes have 1440 x 2560 resolution vs the Moto G4s 1080 x 1920 but on a 5.5 inch screen it does not matter. MOTO has a DPI of 401 which makes the difference unnoticeable.Screen Size. The MOTO G4 has a 5.25 inch screen. They list a 5.5 but as the buttons are on the screen you lose .25 inches of screen that you don't on other phones that have physical buttons in the boarder'. I have found that these disappear when in apps so you get the space back and a simple swipe up brings them back.Android: Version 6.01. This is as close to stock Android which is a plus. There is no bloatware that I could find. It would be great if it was stock android but it is really tough to get a good stock android phone. I am hoping that since it is close to stock that updates will come in a timely fashion. Samsung is the worst for updates. If you have the latest flagship phone from Samsung you will be lucky if you get the latest android updates after every other company has updated their phones. Then you have to wait on the carriers who are just as bad. If you have a phone like my Samsung Note 4 good luck getting updates. I am hoping MOTO is better at putting out updates but really don't know. You at least get rid of 1 level by taking out the carrier updates.Battery: I set the phone up and was using it 100% of the time from about 4:30pm to after midnight and ran the phone down. I then forgot to plug it in over night and it lost almost no power over night 18% down to 13%. Charging with included turbo charger: 30 Mins it went from 13% to 47%. At 1 hour it was at 88%. it hit 100% at 1 hour 40 mins.After 3 days I would say the battery life is not the best. If you don't use it it will last forever. My Samsung Note 4 would be way down with minimal use. It goes down alot faster with use. From 7:30 AM to midnight it went from 100% down to 15%. Most of that when I started using it after work. I am still playing with settings so this will also be updated. 7:30 to 3:30 I am down to 80% from a full charge.Update: I have gone through a number of full battery cycle and the battery seems to be holding up well. I got a day and a half on my last full battery and today I have 66% left from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm. I am happy if it lasts a day as I will always charge it overnight. I just don;t want to be on empty at the end of the day and the last few days seem to be holding up. I still have not tried to optimize anything.After 2 weeks of use I find I have no issues with battery life. I am very happy with it.Storage. Android OS on the Moto G4 plus takes 9.49 GB so a 16GB phone is no longer an option. It really has never been and option. If you are looking at the 16GB version of the MOTO G4 or the plus keep looking. This goes for any Android phone. The upgrade to 64gb was only $50 and included an upgrade of memory from 2gb to 4gb. It is well worth it. Unlike Apple and Samsung who seem to think you should bend over to have a storage upgrade Motorola comes in with a better price.Micro SD: I added 128gb card to store music on and it works great. I have read and suspect it supports up to 256 but those are still cost prohibitive.Finger Print Sensor: The plus has a finger print sensor that works beautifully. I have 2 other devices that have finger print sensors. The Note 4 who's finger print sensor was very poor and was unusable and the Galaxy Tab S2 8"" which seems to function ok. I have had no issue with the MOTO G4 finger print scanner and would rate it superior to either of the Samsung versions I have.App performance: Everything is very smooth and snappy. At this point the OCTACore processor and touch of the screen are excellent. We have gotten to the point when phone CPUs have outpaced need for 95% of the public maybe even 100%. I don't play high entensity 3d games and those might be an issue but I cannot report on that as everything I use works great.WIFI Performance: This works fine. I was getting 50mb a second download off my AC2350 netgear router. Wired I get 130mb second. Once again overkill. I get the same rate from my Samsung Galaxy tab S2 and it supports AC.Look and feel: The size is great. Just a little smaller in your hand than the Note 4 but it makes a lot of difference. I have smaller hands and was always fumbling with the note 4. The MOTO G seems much more natural.No NFC so no Android pay. I still see absolutely no reason to use android pay so it is not a big deal to me. I either have to get my phone out and make the payment or I have to get out my wallet and make the payment. Not a lot of difference. They tried to solve a problem that didn't exist. I guess they assume we are all so consumed with with our online presence that our phone is always in our hands. If you are in line using your phone the person behind you should smack it out of your hands for being rude.Blutooth: Connected a earbud and my PC. Both function fine with no issues.Pokemon Go. Runs fine. seems to have the same issues as my son and daughters iphone 6 and 6s and my old Samsung Note 4. It is a battery hog on all phones and has to be restarted every once in a while. These are common to all 4 phones though.Pros.Price: At 299 the 64GB Moto G Plus (4th Gen) is a steal. It Compares to at least last years flag ship models.Storage:. 64gb is enough for most but if not you can add 128gb micro SD.Screen: Crystal Clear screen very responsiveSetup: Very easy to setup and install apps from prior phoneApps: Run perfectly well with no slow downs. .ConsScreen size of 5.25. Finger print scanner is not the home button and you waste .25"" of screen for the 3 buttons.Speak is a little tinny. Fine for voice calls but you would never want to listen to music over it. earbuds are good and you can always get a set of bluetooth speackers.After 2 weeks I see no reason to buy a Galaxy Note 7 or Iphone 7 for $700 to $800. You are basically paying $500 for less storage, to go from a Great phone camera to the best phone camera and to get NFC. My daughter who is an Apple iLemming even liked it. After using it for a week I gave my wife my Note 4 to upgrade her note 2. This phone is great and I would definitely look at the next one when I need a new phone in a few years.Update 9/16/2016: I still think this is a great phone and am happy with my purchase. Much better than spending 700+ on an exploding galaxy note 7. It does get warm when playing pokemon go and charging at the same time. Other than that I really have no complaints. I do think we will see an explosion of 200-300 phones over the next year as people realize that while the flagship lines have better processors those processors are more than they need. Its like the PC market. Unless you play heavy duty online games, a $400 computer is the same as a $1000+ computer.","331","helpful"

I played with a Note 5 over the 4th and the screen resolution of that is the same. Yes the Notes have 1440 x 2560 resolution vs the Moto G4s 1080 x 1920 but on a 5.5 inch screen it does not matter. MOTO has a DPI of 401 which makes the difference unnoticeable.Screen Size. The MOTO G4 has a 5.25 inch screen. They list a 5.5 but as the buttons are on the screen you lose .25 inches of screen that you don't on other phones that have physical buttons in the boarder'. I have found that these disappear when in apps so you get the space back and a simple swipe up brings them back.Android: Version 6.01. This is as close to stock Android which is a plus. There is no bloatware that I could find. It would be great if it was stock android but it is really tough to get a good stock android phone. I am hoping that since it is close to stock that updates will come in a timely fashion. Samsung is the worst for updates. If you have the latest flagship phone from Samsung you will be lucky if you get the latest android updates after every other company has updated their phones. Then you have to wait on the carriers who are just as bad. If you have a phone like my Samsung Note 4 good luck getting updates. I am hoping MOTO is better at putting out updates but really don't know. You at least get rid of 1 level by taking out the carrier updates.Battery: I set the phone up and was using it 100% of the time from about 4:30pm to after midnight and ran the phone down. I then forgot to plug it in over night and it lost almost no power over night 18% down to 13%. Charging with included turbo charger: 30 Mins it went from 13% to 47%. At 1 hour it was at 88%. it hit 100% at 1 hour 40 mins.After 3 days I would say the battery life is not the best. If you don't use it it will last forever. My Samsung Note 4 would be way down with minimal use. It goes down alot faster with use. From 7:30 AM to midnight it went from 100% down to 15%. Most of that when I started using it after work. I am still playing with settings so this will also be updated. 7:30 to 3:30 I am down to 80% from a full charge.Update: I have gone through a number of full battery cycle and the battery seems to be holding up well. I got a day and a half on my last full battery and today I have 66% left from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm. I am happy if it lasts a day as I will always charge it overnight. I just don;t want to be on empty at the end of the day and the last few days seem to be holding up. I still have not tried to optimize anything.After 2 weeks of use I find I have no issues with battery life. I am very happy with it.Storage. Android OS on the Moto G4 plus takes 9.49 GB so a 16GB phone is no longer an option. It really has never been and option. If you are looking at the 16GB version of the MOTO G4 or the plus keep looking. This goes for any Android phone. The upgrade to 64gb was only $50 and included an upgrade of memory from 2gb to 4gb. It is well worth it. Unlike Apple and Samsung who seem to think you should bend over to have a storage upgrade Motorola comes in with a better price.Micro SD: I added 128gb card to store music on and it works great. I have read and suspect it supports up to 256 but those are still cost prohibitive.Finger Print Sensor: The plus has a finger print sensor that works beautifully. I have 2 other devices that have finger print sensors. The Note 4 who's finger print sensor was very poor and was unusable and the Galaxy Tab S2 8"" which seems to function ok. I have had no issue with the MOTO G4 finger print scanner and would rate it superior to either of the Samsung versions I have.App performance: Everything is very smooth and snappy. At this point the OCTACore processor and touch of the screen are excellent. We have gotten to the point when phone CPUs have outpaced need for 95% of the public maybe even 100%. I don't play high entensity 3d games and those might be an issue but I cannot report on that as everything I use works great.WIFI Performance: This works fine. I was getting 50mb a second download off my AC2350 netgear router. Wired I get 130mb second. Once again overkill. I get the same rate from my Samsung Galaxy tab S2 and it supports AC.Look and feel: The size is great. Just a little smaller in your hand than the Note 4 but it makes a lot of difference. I have smaller hands and was always fumbling with the note 4. The MOTO G seems much more natural.No NFC so no Android pay. I still see absolutely no reason to use android pay so it is not a big deal to me. I either have to get my phone out and make the payment or I have to get out my wallet and make the payment. Not a lot of difference. They tried to solve a problem that didn't exist. I guess they assume we are all so consumed with with our online presence that our phone is always in our hands. If you are in line using your phone the person behind you should smack it out of your hands for being rude.Blutooth: Connected a earbud and my PC. Both function fine with no issues.Pokemon Go. Runs fine. seems to have the same issues as my son and daughters iphone 6 and 6s and my old Samsung Note 4. It is a battery hog on all phones and has to be restarted every once in a while. These are common to all 4 phones though.Pros.Price: At 299 the 64GB Moto G Plus (4th Gen) is a steal. It Compares to at least last years flag ship models.Storage:. 64gb is enough for most but if not you can add 128gb micro SD.Screen: Crystal Clear screen very responsiveSetup: Very easy to setup and install apps from prior phoneApps: Run perfectly well with no slow downs. .ConsScreen size of 5.25. Finger print scanner is not the home button and you waste .25"" of screen for the 3 buttons.Speak is a little tinny. Fine for voice calls but you would never want to listen to music over it. earbuds are good and you can always get a set of bluetooth speackers.After 2 weeks I see no reason to buy a Galaxy Note 7 or Iphone 7 for $700 to $800. You are basically paying $500 for less storage, to go from a Great phone camera to the best phone camera and to get NFC. My daughter who is an Apple iLemming even liked it. After using it for a week I gave my wife my Note 4 to upgrade her note 2. This phone is great and I would definitely look at the next one when I need a new phone in a few years.Update 9/16/2016: I still think this is a great phone and am happy with my purchase. Much better than spending 700+ on an exploding galaxy note 7. It does get warm when playing pokemon go and charging at the same time. Other than that I really have no complaints. I do think we will see an explosion of 200-300 phones over the next year as people realize that while the flagship lines have better processors those processors are more than they need. Its like the PC market. Unless you play heavy duty online games, a $400 computer is the same as a $1000+ computer.","339","helpful"

"Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads","Motorola","149.99","5","First of all, I am picky about phones, tablets...all electronics. Being a techie type, I researched many phones before I decided to purchase this G4 Play...And after using this phone every day, all day long, I have discovered that this was the best choice of a phone for me.Well, I have written my review as if I were you reading reviews trying to decide to buy this phone or not...PROS:+ MICRO SIM CARD -- While Nano Sims are gradually being the standard SIM size and are the size for newer phones, I still like this size.Note to Nano SIM users: You can install a Nano SIM in this phone IF you carefully place it into an adapter or just go to your phone store and they can move your info from your Nano Card to a new Micro SIM card. Be sure you have a new Micro SIM with you in case they do not have one. Amazon sells Micro Sims.+ Size, Weight, and Comfort of the Phone...This 5 inch screen, weight of the phone, comfort while holding this phone are some major reasons why I bought this phone. I had a huge 5.5 Samsung J7 (2015). It was too big for my small hands and very uncomfortable to hold. And because the G4 Play is a lighter weight phone and not bulky, I am love this!This phone fits my hand perfectly and comfortable to hold.+ Memory/Storage has 16GB Internal however after OS and factory apps 10.6 GB left. External card slot can handle up to 256GB.There is no bloatware...pure Android experience...About twenty one essential factory Installed apps including Phone and Help. Most of the apps are Android / Google Apps. Only about six Motorola apps which includes the Camera, File Manager, FM Radio, Phone, Settings and Calc. Motorola allows Android and Google to supply just the Apps you need, however, later on you can install Apps you like as there is plenty of room left. Below is a list of Google / Android Apps pre-installed on this phone:* Calendar (Google Calendar)* Clock (Google Clock)* Contacts (Google)* Chrome Internet Browser* FM Radio App (Moto installed this on this phone, no Internet needed...real FM Radio)* Google App* Google Maps* Google Music* Hangouts (Google)* Messenger (Google Messenger for Texts and MMS (Picture or Video Messages).* Photos (It is a Photo Gallery by Google).* Play Movies/Play Music* Playstore* Settings (Android Settings)Because I just installed Apps I wanted like Facebook, Twitter, PrinterShare and other large Apps, I still have 8.25 GB Internal Storage now left if I want to add more apps later on.+ Memory & Storage Size & Speed ... The Internal Memory and RAM are adequate and I find the phone runs plenty fast and for me, no lagging, never freezes. A very peppy phone in my opinion.+ Marshmallows 6.01 installed and promises to later update to Nougat 7 OS when available. This I am very happy about because my Samsung J7 M model has yet to update to Marshmallow it still has Lollipop. Other J7 models should get it but I am not sure J7 M model my old one ever will.+ Camera...It is just 8MP however, I took inside and outside pictures and they came out very clear in my opinion. This is much to my happy surprise.+ Screen Resolution/Special Screen Information - For me personally, I find the resolution (at 294 PPI - Pixels Per Inch) excellent as the colors in the screen are very bright and vivid and very clear! In fact, webpages and my Kindle Reading app are just stunning on this phone! *All of my pictures and videos are crystal clear with this phone.***OUTSIDE VIEWING in Direct Sunlight with this screen... OK if I turn the screen slightly to the right because the Brightness NITS are about 400 Nits so this is good (adequate). Some more expensive phones have at least 500 Nits...some have close to 700 Nits of brightness. The higher the Brightness Nits the easier it is to see your screen in bright sunlight. * There is no way to increase the Nits on this phone but I could view it somewhat in direct sunlight.+ WiFi and 4G (LTE) (Internet)Info:WiFi Connects to any WiFi and the signal strength is excellent (even in the very back of my home and outside), most of the time I have 4 bars (outside is 3 bars).LTE (Data) When not near a router or WiFi hotspot, then I use LTE (Data) for Internet. The LTE on this phone is LIGHTENING FAST when I use data.* Note: At home, I use WiFi on my secured Router with a password. However, when I travel I use LTE Data on this phone as it is much more secure tha a Open WiFi Hot spot at say a cafe etc. This way, I know I feel more secure on the Internet.+ OTG ΓÇô This phone supports On the Go with the micro USB port so I can add a 256 GB flash drive with my office files, pictures etc and the phone easily reads these files.+ Temperature of the battery and coolness of this phone - This phone and battery runs very cool with the Snapdragon 410 processor (the 600 & higher Snapdragon processors on other devices can run hot). With this phone's 410 cool processor the normal temp and most of the time it is running at 78 F degrees to 87 F degrees. When I download lots of apps or play games, it may get up to 90 degrees for a couple of minutes but goes right down to normal temps. I have run many programs on this phone and it DOES NOT OVERHEAT. I have read that some newer smart phones will sometimes get up as high as 112 degrees, this one for me has not done this.It is important to keep a phone running cooler as it will prolong the life of the phone and it is easier on the battery as well.+ Phone call Clarity/Loudness etc. - Loud enough speaker and sound is very clear, best phone I used..No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset┬áor speaker.The front speaker on this phone is plenty loud...better than my Samsung J7 was!+ BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the very good battery life. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get close to all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning). Also to save battery, I turn off WiFi or Data and tap the ON OFF button (put to sleep). This way, I use my phone into the night on a single charge.+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD (UP TO 256GB SD CARD) - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone! (I placed a 64GB SD Card in this phone and I still have room left).*Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.+ G4 Play Prints pictures and documents! I print pictures, PDF documents, Documents and more right from this phone! I have an HP Envy 4500 Wireless Printer...then I installed PrinterShare from the Playstore...I paid 10 dollars for the Premium version as the free one did not work as well. If you need more info regarding the Printing on Moto G4 Play, please ask me in comment section.+ Music Player..The installed player is Google Play Player, however, I did not like it as it used too much battery/memory so I went to Playstore and installed the free Rocket Player...this uses very little battery and memory and has lots of themes, easy to make Playlist, etc.+ MS Office...I installed free from Playstore WJS OFFICE as I need use this 100 percent compatible MS Office compatible on the road. Works great for me. I highly recommend this free Office app.+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this phone: I downloaded a FREE APP called WPS Office (free) which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.+ Watching Videos online...I use an app called Internet free from Playstore and also Chrome and I watch online videos by pressing the big white arrow in center of video. I have watched all the videos I wanted on several browsers just fine.For Amazon videos there is an Amazon Video app that I discovered that I use on my Android tablet to watch my Amazon videos.CONS:- Just a couple of minor Cons I found...The phone I received did not come with a headset...no problem as I already have a headset that works on this phone. (I prefer a Bluetooth headset because the sound quality us so much better). Amazon offers many plug in or Bluetooth headsets ar low prices.Also, the charger that came with the phone is a slower charger, however, I have a 2 amp charger that I use and it charges this phone quickly.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes in a heartbeat as the size is perfect for me. And for the money, I believe this is the best deal out there dollar for dollar. Will this phone be a good choice for you? Yes, for two reasons.:1) Yes if you want a very easy to use phone.2) Yes if you have small hands and small fingers as the keyboard is small.If you have large hands and large fingers, this phone may be too small for you...so you should then consider a 5.5 inch or higher screen phone.***This phone I recommend to a person wants a smaller, comfortable to hold phone and also a very easy to use phone. ** Personally, I love this phone because it is fits my hands perfectly, easy to use, fun to use and it is a beautiful phone!Thank you for reading this review. I tested the phone thoroughly before I wrote this review. If you have questions about this phone please ask me in the comment section as I am a techie type and will answer right away.","404","helpful"
"Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty","Motorola","249","5","Ok so I've had this Moto G4 Plus (64GB storage with 4GB RAM) for 24 hours, and so this Isn't going to be a extensive review, just some things I've noticed...First of all, the build and feel of the phone is very good, not super premium like some $600 + phones, but its still very good.the fit is tight and uniform, no gaps around the screen or back cover or anything. the back cover snaps on and off without problems. the phone looks to be very well made.The android system takes up almost 10GB of storage, leaving the user with about 54.5 GB.CPU-Z shows there is 3643 MB of RAMThe buttons for power and volume feel great, make a nice little clicky feel when you push them, and the power button is textured for an easy way to feel the difference between them.the finger print scanner, is very useful, (although it doesn't serve as a button for anything) it wakes the phone up and unlocks it super fast.I would estimate about 1/4 of a second or faster. So far finger print scanner is great, way better than i expected.The screen looks great, full HD 1080P, colors have a warm look to them , the whites are not as blue looking as my Samsung phones screen.IT is a full 5.5 inch display, and yes the buttons are on screen, But can go away in certain apps, to give you the full screen to use, like when watching videos for instance.the sound is very good, although it only has one front facing speaker at the top. it is loud and clear.Call quality has been excellent, and when calling an iphone 6, about two or three feet away, with both phones on speaker. the Moto G4 Plus had no signs of feedback, or echoing, indicating it does an excellent job of noise cancellation. the iphone 6 however sounded like a horror movie.The UI (user interface) is slick and basic android. fast and responsive. the Moto gestures work well as far as the double twist for camera, and the double chop for flashlight. I have not tested the others yet.Supposedly this phone is Water and dust resistant, but i will not be testing that, for obvious reasons.The camera seems to be great so far, low light photos look pretty good, and there is even a pro mode that lets you tweak all the aspects of the camera. if you hold down the shoot button, it takes photos in rapid succession, pretty cool feature.This phone also lets you record slow motion videos which is fun.Some of the cons of this phone i can think of, are:No NFC, not a big deal to me personally, because I never plan on using android pay anytime soon at least, and I never bump my phone to share stuff with other people. I've had NFC on past phones for years, and never used it, except to try it out to see if it worked.No Magnetometer / Compass. I'm not sure of the full implications of not having a compass are, but GPS and navigation still work, because they rely on the GPS sensors, this phone also uses GLONASS, which is just the Russian version of the United states GPS system, twice as many satellites, means twice the reliability, and more accurate and faster positioning.Since there is no Compass, google sky map will not work correctly, which is big bummer for me.ON THE OVER HEATING ISSUE:I live in south Texas, and tested this phone outside with the camera app, taking dozens of photos and using CPU-Z i never noticed temps over 55 C on any of the sensors, most were about 50 C or below. also the camera app never started lagging and stuttering.I will update this review if anything changes, and after a month or two when i have spent more time with the phone.EDIT: after using this phone for 4 days now. I bumped it from a 4 to a 5 star. The battery life is very good. And easily last all day. In fact I've had the phone with me at work now since 7 am this morning, using it off and on pretty often. It is now 2:30 pm and I still have 70% left. Pretty impressive.The screen looks great in full sun with full brightness setting, no problems at all.The more I use this phone the more I like it.","518","helpful"

Phone arrived 3 days after order in good condition . Nice box with quick start guide ,charger, (2) screen protectors, one already installed , ear buds and short and long usb cords for wall mount charger. I was hoping the phone would have a manual but it did not. Quick start guide was very basic. Battery was not installed and was not even partially charged. I would like to also note that I sent two different emails to Neoix with questions about phone after purchase and neither have been answered yet. One question was about a phone case. I noticed in the questions section that they replied a case would be sent with new purchases. I did not receive one.Now on to the phone review. So far , it seems very fast and very nicely laid out on the home pages. Controls are familiar and work flawlessly so far. I had no problem connecting to my wifi or setting up to my straight talk provider. So far I am happy with the phone. Not so much with the seller at this point. Will update again soon.8/13/16Well The phone is still working but there are issues. First , this phone will randomly delete my contacts. Then sometimes when I search for a contact , it doesn't find it but when they text or call they reappear. Volume is not very loud for ringer. Talk volume is fine . Phone sometimes won't download pics during texting. Even if on wifi. That along with the fact that it is not going to upgrade to marshmallow is very disappointing. I had high hopes but I am currently looking for another phone. Dropped rating from 4 starts to 3","14","helpful"

It looks sleek and modern, and It has some of the functions that a ""smartphone"" would have. It worked with AT&T here in the US with a simple SIM card switch. I love the qwerty keyboard and I am overall very happy with all the phone has to offer, except for the 2 megapoixel camera. I would be willing to pay more if the camera was like, 5 megapixels.This is the best ""dumbphone"" out there.

"Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone","Nokia","59.95","3","I really like the phone, looks great, sound is great, quick learning curve, but the battery life sucks. I put it on the charger before bed and it doesn't even completely charge after 6 hours of non-use. Then the battery is almost dead after a couple of hours of non-use off the charger. Not sure if it's just a bad battery from the supplier or the design of the phone itself.Not sure why the first time I sent a review in it said 'A kids review' I'm 48 years old!** Update Feb 19,2011 **The battery that came with the phone continued to get worst, to the point that if I wanted to make a call that would last 10 mins or so, I would have to plug it in and use it as a corded phone.

I took it with me, but wasn't able to use it overseas because I hadn't set it up in my plan, however when I returned I used it quite a bit. I like it, but it's quirky. I don't text much, but the first time I did, I realized that the punctuation marks were not where the keys indicated. Press the exclamation key and it actually types quotes, press the question mark key to get left parenthesis, and the apostrophe key yields a question mark, etc.On top of that, I wanted to call the ferry service to make sure I had the time of the last ride home, but it was impossible for me to figure out how to call 1-877-44FERRY. On my old phone numbers were on letter keys, and it was simple. With dedicated number keys, 1-0, it was impossible to type in the letters because on my old phone an 'F' is on the '3' key, but on this phone, with the control-key activating the numbers, the 'F' key is on the '4' key; not at all linear, and the 'Y"" key is not connected to a number at all. I was stressed enough that I couldn't pull up a mental image of the old phone's alpha-numeric setup to use. Bad day at Black Rock, but I got the last ferry back home, anyway.It's too late to request a return, so I'm stuck. As a phone, it's fine. I use it occasionally to check my email, and am getting used to its quirks when I send the occasional text. It's larger than I like, but that's normal for a smartphone.","6","helpful"

I don't have my music on the phone, and I haven't taken many pictures, so it's not that I'm using the phone past it's limits.

"Nokia E5-00 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy Email Setup, IM, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, Ovi Store with Apps, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (White)","Nokia","115","5","Ok, so I purchased this for a few reasons a) I didn't want to get locked into a contract with AT&T because I don't want a data plan and all the new phones try to force it on you; b)No touchscreen!!! (I hate touchscreens); c) It has buttons!! :) (Did I mention that I hate touchscreen?); c) This phone was advertised as being both US and Int'l. A little bird who works for AT&T told me that their system has trouble reading int'l phones. If their system sees a smart phone it will automatically add a data plan whether you ask for it or not (that just seems illegal to me!.) However, they have trouble with int'l phones so the data plans may not automatically be added. [In my case, that didn't work completely. A data plan was added. I did call and demanded that the data plan be removed. The girl I spoke with did seem to have trouble figuring out what kind of cell phone I had. She kept asking me for specifics on it, which I did not give her. All she got out of me was ""I have a Nokia"" and ""No, I don't know what kind it is"". The data plan came off. (Hope it stays off!!)]So, the phone has buttons and does not have touchscreen!! YAY!! (This is HUGE in my book!) Overall, I think I like this phone. I really loved my old phone so it was difficult accepting a new one but as I've gotten used to it, I do like it. It has great reception. It's fast.... text messages go out quickly, wifi is quick. I do like the GPS feature that comes with the phone, especially since you don't need internet to use it. I must warn everyone that the phone will need updates and FYI, updating the GPS maps can take a VERY long time. I started the process at work and had to leave my phone at work overnight because after 6 hours, the map updates were only about 50% complete. Be aware of this and plan to update the maps accordingly. Updates of the phone software itself is quick. The syncing software that comes with this phone is very clean and easy to navigate. It also holds a charge VERY well and is not a battery hog. This phone was perfectly designed for those of us who reject the hysteria around iPhones et al, need a phone for calls and texting only, and aren't looking for a new toy.Overall, if you're trying to avoid data plans but want a smart phone for the buttons (for ease of texting) plus a few other perks, I'd say this phone is the way to go. I've had it for about a month at this point and so far I am very satisfied.","6","helpful"

Please also note this is my second time owning a Nokia 5800. The first time was a European model with US warranty since i got it from the Nokia Flagship store in Chicago. That had the first firmware with no updates...and it sucked. Sucked so bad I sold it used because I couldnt wait for the firmware upgrade. So now we advance to today. And with great relief, I tell you people that this Nokia 5800 Nam is an outstanding smartphone. The most current firmware 20.0.012 has made this Nok great. I know this because I have owned both. I take off .50 because no the UI is not as pretty as the Iphone, nothing is when it comes to touch. the other .25 is because when you activate the pretty animations for the touch interface, it does slow it down. So I do turn it off to keep it running smoothly. This is a best seller for Nokia, therefore they will continue to give us better software updates to make it run even smoother. Their is no crazy ear piece problem. The phone feels so easy fitting in one hand. This cant be said of the Iphone. The Iphone is awsome yes, but its kinda big to use as a cellphone. ok let me real this in. The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen. As for the touch method, the iphone once again is kewler and smooth however the resistive touch screen is CLEARLY improved and does not hold you back. Clearly the firmware upgrade tweaked the sensitivity and made it much more responsive. im all over the place with this review, im sorry. if only Nokia could do better marketin partnerships and get this to a local Best Buy so people can touch it and feel how great it is...that for me is one of it biggest selling points...","14","helpful"

The Iphone is awsome yes, but its kinda big to use as a cellphone. ok let me real this in. The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen. As for the touch method, the iphone once again is kewler and smooth however the resistive touch screen is CLEARLY improved and does not hold you back. Clearly the firmware upgrade tweaked the sensitivity and made it much more responsive. im all over the place with this review, im sorry. if only Nokia could do better marketin partnerships and get this to a local Best Buy so people can touch it and feel how great it is...that for me is one of it biggest selling points...","14","helpful"
"Nokia 6085 Unlocked Phone with Camera, Bluetooth and QuadBand - US Warranty - Pink","Nokia","269.1","5","I must say I got this cell phone for my mother who's around her sixties and she hates advanced phones so she was looking for something simple. So I got on Amazon searching for her favorite phone color which is Pink and found this phone that was ATT and unlocked. Then I immediately showed her and she fell in love with it because it was something simple and basic she can use when she needs to keep in contact with all her family. When the phone arrived it was a very nice phone and something anyone can figure out. Over all I totally recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't like advanced touch screen phones or those smart phones, this phone is perfect for someone who just wants it for taking pictures and talking on the cell phone for constant communication.","14","helpful"

"Nokia C1-01 Unlocked GSM Phone--US Version with Warranty (Dark Grey)","Nokia","269.1","5","I was looking for a phone to replace my Nokia 3100 which has been a diehard. After reading the first and only review i took a chance and could not be happier. What made it even better was my wife's excitement about the phone. She is not very exciteable. So it was a real plus when she told me that she really like the phone. I was just looking for a good basic reliable phone, and got many more features than expected. I knew that it had a music player, but the 5 mp camera was icing on the cake. If you're willing to spend more, I'm sure there are better phones. But thus far me and my wife are very satisfied!","14","helpful"
"Nokia C1-01 Unlocked GSM Phone--US Version with Warranty (Dark Grey)","Nokia","269.1","5","This is a great little phone if you like the candy bar format (as I do). While it's great to have a camera, radio, mp3 player, qwerty keyboard nearby, to me the most important feature of phone is how is functions as a phone. This one is perfect for making and taking phone calls on. As silly as that may sound, I cannot say enough how much I abhor trying to hold an I-phone up to my ear for any length of time. It just doesn't feel right. This one has a great feel to it. Very sleek and discreet. Big clean display relative to overall size. Nice audio quality and still slips into your shirt pocket without you even knowing it's there. ATT has informed that I will have to get a different phone as they will be shutting down their 2G network in May. Hopefully this one still works.","14","helpful"

"Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone","Nokia","59.95","4","This is like a Tale of Two Cities - it was the worst of times, it was the best of times. The phone is great. It has good sound quality, useful features, good fit-and-finish. The speakerphone works exceptionally well. I searched around for a decently priced phone (you can get this unlocked for $120 shipped) that could sync my contacts, calendar and task list, would work as a tethered modem, could link to an email account and had web access. This is what I ended up with.The down side is that the sync software offered by Nokia is total crap. DO NOT use the Ovi Suite software if you need to sync your Outlook data - it has a nasty habit of overwriting your Outlook data file. If you are lucky, it will just create a mess. If you are unlucky - well, I hope you backed up your data lately. Much less problematic is Nokia's PC Suite - it is the predecessor to Ovi Suit. It too has problems (I could only get it to sync 30 contacts at a time) but it is much less buggy. The down side to PC Suite is that Nokia is abandoning its support/updates for this software. Right now, there are plenty of forums that provide good answers to common problems.If this phone does not have the features you want go to phonescoop.com and click on the ""phone finder"" link.

Gone are the days paying $15 to connect to the internet at airports and hotels. Simply use the mini usb cable or download a symbian based modem application and you can use your phone as your modem.The camera is decent (2mb) and since micro sd cards are so cheap nowadays (i bought a 4gb Kingston one at Amazon for $14) you can use this phone also as a portable mp3 player (stereo ear phones included).The best part of all though; it runs on Symbian. Download Opera mini and Google Maps (with a neat 'show current location function) and you have the capability to browse html pages and use the phone as a water down gps device.","14","helpful"

"Nokia Lumia 1520 16GB AT&T GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone w/ Cortana and 20MP Camera with Carl-Zeiss Optics - Black","Nokia","204.99","1","Though the OS is second to none IMO - and the design, shape and size being brilliant, I have to score this phone (not necessarily the AT&T or TMO branded phones), but the Nokia factory phone, as lame. When I first got it the OS was 8.0 and I had a few issues.1. The unlock screen would register taps that I did not do. This being rectified by hitting the power button to lock it and then bring it back to the unlock screen.2. Sometimes when the keyboard would come up it would be all fuzzy, though it would clear up after 5 - 10 seconds, it was hard to read and sucked to have to wait.3. Signal strength at certain locations (my house for one) would drop to no service. This in comparison to my 925,821 and HTC 8x, where the signal was fine. So I am not sure if this is a phone issue or a TMO service issue. But TMO sent out a signal booster and that did not do much.Nokia says it is TMO's fault cuz the signal is fine downtown and therefore cannot be hardware so it must be TMO - Makes sense. TMO says it is Nokia's fault because my other phones work at home and the 1520 does not, which also makes sense.4. Camera button seems to be hyper sensitive, so much so that if you touch the housing on the back of the phone and not the actual button the camera will come on.. though this is not an every time occurrence, it happens enough to be a major pain when trying to actual do work on the phone.So I installed windows 8.1 - now since it is not a supported OS, TMO no longer cares nor does Nokia.So I am stuck with a phone where at home I have no service and when I am out and about and want to do something on the phone I have the lock screen issue and the damned camera problem to contend with.. Though on the plus side, the blurry keyboard problem seemed to have gone away with 8.1.Updated 6.27.2014It has been 114 days since purchase and the screen is registering multiple touches, and at different locations. Example, phone pad open you hit 3 and it will sometimes register two 3's, or a 1 3 and and 8.. This I mention above and thought it was software.. turns out if you look at the screen from an angle you can actually see the registered click on the 8 when touching the 3.. Microsoft stored confirmed it was hardware failure, suggested to return it.Mobile front only has something like a 15 day grace period for returns\exchanges. Amazon cannot\will not do anything because they do not have to.Called Nokia, they say that there is a 1 year factory warranty on the device but that it is only for the originating order, ie Mobile Front.. so they cannot do anything.So Nokia has a 1 year warranty on it with Mobile Front and MF turns around and gives you a 15 day warranty.My bad for not looking more into that before ordering.Will never buy 3rd party again..

"Nokia Lumia 925 RM-893 GSM Unlocked 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black/Dark Grey","Nokia","99","5","Before I purchased I contacted the seller to make sure the version he sells is for US T-mobile and will enable 4G LTE. The box I got was a Tmobile box, it even included a microSIMcard. I have had it for a week now and I am getting 4g LTE speeds and everything seems to be working very well! I am so happy about my purchase from an Amazon seller, because the price was $200 less regular price for T-mobile customers. Just make sure you ask the seller directly which version it is - there are 3 versions of Lumia 925: RM-892 (international), RM-893 (US version for Tmobile and AT&T), RM-910 (asia version with no 4G) (source: Wikipedia). I got the RM-893 and 4G LTE works great on T-Mobile.","14","helpful"
"Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 4 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)","Nokia","79","4","Ever since I have used smart phones, nokia and symbian s60 has been my favorites, my last two phones being the n95-3 and the e71. I was hoping to hold out until the n97 but decided to give the 5800 a try.The phone itself is built very solidly for a midrange phone, there's no worry about dropping it and having it break on you, the screen is also very nice, this may not be the slimmest phone out there but it feels very comfortable in your hand, and the resolution looks amazing. I have a minor concern with the battery cover, it seems like it was more of an afterthought in the design of the device, there is no buttons or latches to secure it, just a few tabs that u click it into...I hope this doesn't break on me quickly.....but I don't see a need to be removing the cover very often, as the memory card and SIM card are inserted through the side, meaning this phone can have its memory cards switched very easily.The user interface seems like a quick and dirty job, it is basically the s60 v3 operating system with some bigger icons to make selection by touch a little easier. Not a major overhaul on the operating system basically everything looks the same as previous nokia smart phones, the camera, video, and music interfaces could have made better use of finger controls in my opinion.Another major concern that hopefully will be alleviated soon is the lack of third party apps, I'm assuming this operating system is still an infant and over time developers will start adapting their existing apps to use on touch devices.Handwriting recognition is my favorite input methods, although the full screen QWERTY comes in a close second. The t9 keypad works great for one handed operations, and the mini QWERTY keyboard is a joke.I was disappointed to see that the US version does not ship with an extra stylus, NOR DOES IT HAVE A CARRYING CASE.","15","helpful"

This phone is an EU phone that is being offered here in the US to gain market share and put the phone in the hands of the more casual user. Go ahead, go to CNET and PCworld and check out the reviews; the E63 is typically compared with units costing 2-3 times as much. So, it falls a bit short in some areas (camera, headphones, et al) so, it's not perfect. For under $200, who cares? Come on. All current phones are obsolete in three years anyway, (or after the first drop on the airport floor)!The E63's got a vivid screen, great speaker, gets FM radio, a decent app store @ NOKIA.com, MicroSD slot, easy to sync up, great build quality and offers clear reception for TMobile, ATT and international travel, whenever we decide to do that again. QKeyboard, ability to netsurf in hotspots w/o dataplan, US WARRANTY and by the way, currently less than $150 beans with rebate. And no two-year contract. Yankee Blue or Sox Red, they easily stand out among the Crackberry drones. Wake up and smell the symbian, Baby...getting a great deal is the hot trend.","15","helpful"

I do miss ability to connect via wi-fi (because I've never tried any of the internet features)... but I'm too cheap to burn my pay-as-you-go minutes for internet.

"Nokia C3-01 Unlocked Touch and Type GSM Phone--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)","Nokia","269.1","5","I purchased this phone as a gift for my teenage daughter, she loves the phone...Initially, she was upset at me as I didn't ask her about her thoughts on what kind of phone she would prefer, so I thought I could use this phone if she didn't like it, well, after playing a bit with it, she got in love with this nice piece of technology...She is used to texting via traditional keypad, so she loves the idea of navigating through menus and options via the touchscreen while keeping the phone keypad for dialing and texting functions. Quality of the phone is great (my daughter has tons of pics she can keep in a large memory microSD card, so this is a plus too), the phone feels very resistant and the silver version is very elegant, fits perfectly into small pockets. You'll need to adjust touch screen sensitivity to your preferrences, but the phone has a good feature for completing this task easily. 3G and Wifi capabilities works great in my country, and even when my daugthers' sim card is from 2G technology, the phone has extraordinary reception at areas where her previous 2-3 Nokia phones (various Music express models) never had signal. Quality of pictures are awesome (have not used the flash at this time, but we'll see...). Overall, I highly recommend this phone for someone who needs good battery performance, nice quality pictures, all good stuff such as music, videos, etc., good signal reception and also wanting to keep keypad control for dialing/ texting while improving menu navigation through touch screen...Great product!","16","helpful"

"Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone","Nokia","59.95","5","Since I was due for an early upgrade on my plan, I checked around in the AT&T store for non-smartphone messaging-only options that did not require a data plan. Sadly, there were just a handful of options, half of which were unappealing flip style phones that I used over 10 years ago. AT&T store personnel stated that AT&T is intentionally driving existing customers to higher revenue smartphone and data plans and de-emphasizing messaging-only phones.*sigh*. Thanks for reducing customer options AT&T.So the search began to see what options existed in third party unlocked phones. The Nokia C3-00 caught my eye largely because it looked very much like my previous QWERTY bar phone, but it also had FM stereo and Wifi capability which had the potential to dramatically improve its day-to-day flexibility. In addition, user reviews across multiple internet review sites gave it overwhelmingly positive reviews.Before purchase I had some initial concerns about whether or not AT&T would identify the phone on their network as a smartphone since it uses the Symbian S40 operating system. AT&T said the phone's IMEI number is not among their list of smartphone IMEI's. I've gone through my first billing cycle and can confirm no forced smartphone data plan charges were assessed.As for the phone itself, day-to-day use has been great. Plugged my SIM card into it from the old phone (Pantech Link) and its worked beautifully right out of the box from day one. No problems at all.Battery life is typically 3-4 days between charges with moderate texting and several hours of daily FM stereo usage at work. Better than expected.Wifi works OK, not very speedy, but it does enable access to personal email and MSNBC/CNN at Starbucks. Just don't expect an iPhone-type browsing experience. It's basic but gets the job done. Better than expected. Note: If you DO opt for a data plan for this phone, bear in mind that it's an EDGE phone, not a 3G phone, so your data transfer speeds under a paid data plan will likely be a little underwhelming.FM stereo works super and is a nice inclusion on a phone at this price level. Earphone cord acts as the antenna and must be plugged in for reception. Sounds great, and again, better than expected.Keyboard is typical QWERTY layout. I found the tactile feedback quite pleasant and was easier to text on it than previous phone.Call quality is very good. No dropped calls. I can hear callers loud and clear and they can hear me the same.Nothing bothersome about the texting experience. It has a conversation mode similar to other phones and it works well. Only complaint is that individual texts within a conversation will only display the first two lines of the text. You have to drill into the text to see it fully. Not terribly annoying, but adds an extra step to the texting process. I suppose you have to accept some compromises when working with a 2.4 in display screen.Overall, I'd have have to say this has been a terrific phone choice for me. At $99, it's priced very well, offers expanded feature content and NO DATA PLAN requirement. It's a worthy option to similar carrier-provided messaging phones and a great value.

"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (Black)","Nokia","59.95","4","I came from an N85 so I'm fairly familiar with Nokia phones in general and the Symbian OS in particular.I wanted a touchscreen phone that had a keyboard that was within my budget. I would have gone for the mini N97 but it's a bit pricey considering the C7, N8 et al are coming out soon.I've read almost all available reviews I can read online so if you did that then you know what you're getting into with this phone.The only thing that surprised me was the resistive touchscreen. I bought this phone expecting to return it immediately but the touchscreen compared to my capacitive 2G ipod touch is amazing. It's just as responsive and accurate. I was expecting to need a stylus or my nails to navigate the phone but you really don't!It is, however, a bit bulky but compared to the N85, it's pretty much the same.The NokiaMaps is redunkulous, tho.I LOVE it. The last time I checked it out was when I got my N85. The Nokia maps back then required a crazy-expensive yearly rate to use the turn-by-turn and was pretty much useless bec trying to enter an adddress REQUIRED a zipcode entry before it will search for it! This new interface works much like GoogleMaps (esp with an ovi account) and much easier to use. It has all the feature you can ever want on a stand alone GPS but you get a phone along with it!I specifically bought this phone to try out the NokiaMaps turn-by-turn while I rode my motorcycle. You can't beat an accurate GPS that you can plug your headphones/ bluetooth headset on and use while riding!

"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (White)","Nokia","99.95","4","I came from an N85 so I'm fairly familiar with Nokia phones in general and the Symbian OS in particular.I wanted a touchscreen phone that had a keyboard that was within my budget. I would have gone for the mini N97 but it's a bit pricey considering the C7, N8 et al are coming out soon.I've read almost all available reviews I can read online so if you did that then you know what you're getting into with this phone.The only thing that surprised me was the resistive touchscreen. I bought this phone expecting to return it immediately but the touchscreen compared to my capacitive 2G ipod touch is amazing. It's just as responsive and accurate. I was expecting to need a stylus or my nails to navigate the phone but you really don't!It is, however, a bit bulky but compared to the N85, it's pretty much the same.The NokiaMaps is redunkulous, tho.I LOVE it. The last time I checked it out was when I got my N85. The Nokia maps back then required a crazy-expensive yearly rate to use the turn-by-turn and was pretty much useless bec trying to enter an adddress REQUIRED a zipcode entry before it will search for it! This new interface works much like GoogleMaps (esp with an ovi account) and much easier to use. It has all the feature you can ever want on a stand alone GPS but you get a phone along with it!I specifically bought this phone to try out the NokiaMaps turn-by-turn while I rode my motorcycle. You can't beat an accurate GPS that you can plug your headphones/ bluetooth headset on and use while riding!

"Nokia X3-02 Factory Unlocked Touch and Type GSM Phone - Dark Metal (International Version) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","Nokia","264.1","5","Like many others, I have been a long time fan of Nokia phones, they are not always the most high end of phones like the current Iphone or androids but I myself dont really need to carry around a $400 dual-core processor android phone all day. That's what my laptop is for! I have gone through many phones with T-mobile and the prices of phones just get more expensive and they are just cheesy phones, In my opinion. When I first saw this phone I knew it was love at first sight. Something about the simplicity of the candy bar style design of nokia phones just intrigues me, especially with the design of this new x3 touch and type. Its refreshingly new and sleek. and almost as slim as my 4g Ipod touch which makes it easy to carry around in your pocket with no hassle. not like all those other heavy touch screen phones that mimic the Iphone. Its almost weightless, yet heavy enough to remind you of the quality. The quality of the touch screen is not high definition by any means, but very good considering it's a Nokia. Being able to text with the keypad and use the touch screen to navigate through menus and settings and such is a perfect combination on this phone. You really have to hold it in your hand to experience it. And its a nokia so the battery life is awesome of course. I read a few bad reviews on this phone before I bought it, but if your looking for a simple yet smart little phone that is very easy to use and reliable then this nokia is the phone for you! Anyone who likes the touchscreen feature but doesnt need all those apps and useless programs on the newer phones this is your phone!!!","17","helpful"

This Nokia has good reception w/ T-mobile, and the volume is good. The best feature is the FM radio. The antenna provided by Nokia is weak, so I recommend using an alternate - any 2.5mm headset will work fine. Just for comparison, I spent $300 on my previous phone, a light-weight Samsung phone w/ FM radio. I was disappointed with the Samsung - the phone itself was fine, but it used proprietary adaptors limiting my headset options. I bought 3 Samsung headsets, and all produced too much static for the FM radio to be useful.","18","helpful"

It is fast for most uses, with no lag. Faster than my Note 2. It may not have as many apps as Android, but the Apps that I downloaded look just as good, if not better then their Android versions. One feature that I did not know about is the double tap to turn on, similar to the LG feature. I had trouble getting it to recognize my Gmail account, but the Windows Update fixed it.

"Nokia Lumia 900 16GB Unlocked GSM Phone with Windows 7.5 OS, AMOLED Touchscreen, 8MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio and microSD Slot - White","Nokia","150","4","Before I comment on the product, I must mention that when I received it in the ATT box with the ATT logo on it I was terrified the phone would be locked. As it turns out, the phone is unlocked. No issues there. Also, I'm not on AT&T. I'm on Simple Mobile, which runs on TMobile, so my comment on 3g/4g speeds will be non-existent.1. Fantastic reception on the phone so far. Where I couldn't get reception in the past, I get a strong signal on this phone. Many people blame reception solely on networks, but obviously phone reception plays a part.2. Enough apps for me. I'm not a mass appeal games freak, so I'm not going to lose the plot at the fewer games available, and, heaven forbid, needing to pay $0.99 for Angry birds. I can get all the other things that I want, either the same app as Android or by a third party that fulfills the same function (was on android before this)3. The battery life is ok. It lasts through a day and then some, of course depending what you use it for. I use the phone for calls, some surfing, apps for a range of thing from weather to my Sonos to the kindle.4. Fantastic price. I know Lumia 920 is out but I also know a one year old model is young enough to be relevant and old enough to receive the shipment of the model without the initial launch quirks.5. Xbo smartglass works well, which isn't a big deal but it's a nice convenience when I'm watching netflix on the xbox from the bed.6. Stable. Actually stable.7. The ringer volume has a huge range. That was an issue with my last phone. I like the range. 0-30.As time goes by I'm sure I'll have more to add and maybe it'll show itself to be a dud (though I honestly hope not). Maybe some day Tmobile/Simple Mobile will add the required frequency to get 3g on this phone but I have no issues with Edge for what I use the data access for and I'm mightly pleased with this pretty piece of mobile technology. When everyone had Nokia phones, I never had one, so I'm surprised that I've gone there with this, but they did a good job. I hope they survive the slump they're in because they make good phones.","18","helpful"

"Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone","Nokia","59.95","5","This phone is amazing. For $120, Nokia really hit the nail on the head this time.Wi-Fi:This is probably my favorite feature of the phone. While most phones that have Wi-Fi are smartphone and require a data plan from the carrier, this phone doesn't. It has wi-fi, but it's NOT a smartphone. This is a great feature for those of us who want to browse the internet or check email, without being tied to an annoying contract. And let's face it, there's wi-fi almost everywhere now so finding a connection shouldn't be hard. The wifi is fast a reliable on this phone, and it's just so convenient.Screen:The screen is terrific for such a budget phone. The resolution isn't crazy high, but it's very crisp and easy to read. As far as I know, there is no option to adjust the brightness of the screen, but that's not a big problem because the brightness is perfect for all situation. Even in sunlight, the screen is remarkably readable.Battery Life:I only go the phone yesterday, so I really don't know about the battery life. According to other websites, however, it has 7 hours or talk time. Not impressive, but still pretty good. It also depends on if your wi-fi is turned on and stuff like that.UI (Interface):This phone uses the Nokia S40 use interface. This interface is pleasantly simple, yet has all the features you need. There are a few apps that come preloaded onto the phone, but whenever I try to go to the OVI Store, it says this phone is not compatible. This might be an issue with the browser or maybe the phone just ISN'T supported. But that shouldn't be too much of a problem because people shouldn't buy this phone expecting an iPhone. The phone also gives you easy access to your favorite social networks from the homescreen, which I find a great feature paired with the included wi-fi (I don't have a data plan).QWERTY Keyboard:The keyboard is perfect. The keys may a little small and intimidating, but even for those of us who have thick fingers, typing will become a breeze. The keys are stiff enough to prevent accidental presses, but at the same time, they are easy to press. Perfect combination, eh? Also, I've noticed that on a lot of phones, the keys make a loud *click* noise when they're pressed. This phone barely even makes a noise. I would have to say that the navigation pad above the QWERTY keyboard is a little ""loud"" at first, especially the directional pad, but you soon get used to it.Text Messaging:I couldn't be happier with the texting experience on this phone. The messages are displayed in a conversational manner for each contact, and you can even assign the dedicated e-mail key to go to the conversations (texting) screen. I find this really helpful because it let's me keep track of who I was talking to and what I was talking to them about.Email:The email on this phone is good. The ""app"" takes about 6 seconds to load up after you press ""Mail"" in the menu, but then it's pretty quick. You can have multiple accounts, and all you have to input is you username and password. The phone does the rest, so no need to find the server addresses and ports or whatever you need. I've never really had email on a phone, but I must say it's very convenient.Internet Browser:There are 2 internet browsers that I'm aware of. I have no idea what the default first one is called, but the second one is Opera Mini. I personally like the first one better better, and that's because you control the cursor with the directional keys, while in Opera Mini, you basically use them to select an element..... It's hard to explain. Also, the internet is fast if you have fast wifi. This phone only supports EDGE and GPRS, so no 3G. (YouTube works, but the videos only play in low resolution).Media Player:The media player is great on this phone, too. There are many different file formats that the phone can play. It can even play MIDI audio files (I've never seen that on a phone). My favorite part about the player is them including a 5-band equalizer. This equalizer greatly improves the sound quality. I have mine set to - left to right - HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH. The headphones that come with the phone aren't the greatest, so using a different pair would drastically improve the sound quality.Classy Look:This phone looks pretty awesome. The area around the screen is this plastic material but it's reflective so it's looks really luxurious. The battery cover is made of metal (aluminum I think), and that really gives it a ""heavy"", quality look. I actually ordered a case with the phone (Premium Crystal Skin Case for NOKIA C3 / Clear Tinted) and it fits perfectly, I highly recommend it. The keyboard is sort of a matte finish, and it makes the key comfortable to type on. The device as a whole is just gorgeous, and to be honest, it really looks like a ""Nokia BlackBerry"" or something. I really like the look.Camera:The camera is a 2 MP camera, with digital zoom, but no flash, and no auto-focus. The picture quality on the phone is average for phones in this price range. The pictures look like visual effects have been slammed onto them. I would recommend using the camera to take the occasional picture of somebody to put as a contact, but that's about it. The video camera is, I believe, QVGA resolution @20FPS, (or 15, not quite sure), which isn't great but it gets the job done.Call Quality:The sound quality of the phone is great. I've had no problem hearing anybody, and vice versa.--VERDICT--I would say the only flaw with this phone is that it doesn't make me sandwiches. But all kidding aside, I really do love this phone. My favorite features are the amazing QWERTY keyboard, the included wi-fi networking capabilities, and the threaded text messaging. What more could you want for a $120 phone that's not ""smart"" (hehe). The fact that it has wi-fi but isn't a smartphone is great. You can browse the internet without getting tied up in data plans and contracts and all that stuff because it's unlocked. The browsing experience is good, and the email is convenient. The social network integration to the home screen is great because you don't have to browse to the website or whatever. All-in-all, this is a great phone and I'm very happy I bought it. Oh yes, by the way, it makes calls. :PEDIT 2/5/2012 - Regarding the battery life, this phone has AMAZING battery life. In the review I said it was average, but after using it for a longer time, I can go 5 days with average/heavy use and still have 2/3 bars. It seems insane, but it's true. However, that might be due to the fact that I don't access AT&T's data features, which may drag the battery life down a bit if used frequently.","19","helpful"

It's hard to explain. Also, the internet is fast if you have fast wifi. This phone only supports EDGE and GPRS, so no 3G. (YouTube works, but the videos only play in low resolution).Media Player:The media player is great on this phone, too. There are many different file formats that the phone can play. It can even play MIDI audio files (I've never seen that on a phone). My favorite part about the player is them including a 5-band equalizer. This equalizer greatly improves the sound quality. I have mine set to - left to right - HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH. The headphones that come with the phone aren't the greatest, so using a different pair would drastically improve the sound quality.Classy Look:This phone looks pretty awesome. The area around the screen is this plastic material but it's reflective so it's looks really luxurious. The battery cover is made of metal (aluminum I think), and that really gives it a ""heavy"", quality look. I actually ordered a case with the phone (Premium Crystal Skin Case for NOKIA C3 / Clear Tinted) and it fits perfectly, I highly recommend it. The keyboard is sort of a matte finish, and it makes the key comfortable to type on. The device as a whole is just gorgeous, and to be honest, it really looks like a ""Nokia BlackBerry"" or something. I really like the look.Camera:The camera is a 2 MP camera, with digital zoom, but no flash, and no auto-focus. The picture quality on the phone is average for phones in this price range. The pictures look like visual effects have been slammed onto them. I would recommend using the camera to take the occasional picture of somebody to put as a contact, but that's about it. The video camera is, I believe, QVGA resolution @20FPS, (or 15, not quite sure), which isn't great but it gets the job done.Call Quality:The sound quality of the phone is great. I've had no problem hearing anybody, and vice versa.--VERDICT--I would say the only flaw with this phone is that it doesn't make me sandwiches. But all kidding aside, I really do love this phone. My favorite features are the amazing QWERTY keyboard, the included wi-fi networking capabilities, and the threaded text messaging. What more could you want for a $120 phone that's not ""smart"" (hehe). The fact that it has wi-fi but isn't a smartphone is great. You can browse the internet without getting tied up in data plans and contracts and all that stuff because it's unlocked. The browsing experience is good, and the email is convenient. The social network integration to the home screen is great because you don't have to browse to the website or whatever. All-in-all, this is a great phone and I'm very happy I bought it. Oh yes, by the way, it makes calls. :PEDIT 2/5/2012 - Regarding the battery life, this phone has AMAZING battery life. In the review I said it was average, but after using it for a longer time, I can go 5 days with average/heavy use and still have 2/3 bars. It seems insane, but it's true. However, that might be due to the fact that I don't access AT&T's data features, which may drag the battery life down a bit if used frequently.","19","helpful"
"Nokia C3-00 Unlocked Cell Phone (Slate) with QWERTY, Dedicated E-mail Key, 2 MP Camera, Media Player, WLAN, and MicroSD Slot","Nokia","49.99","5","This phone is amazing. For $120, Nokia really hit the nail on the head this time.Wi-Fi:This is probably my favorite feature of the phone. While most phones that have Wi-Fi are smartphone and require a data plan from the carrier, this phone doesn't. It has wi-fi, but it's NOT a smartphone. This is a great feature for those of us who want to browse the internet or check email, without being tied to an annoying contract. And let's face it, there's wi-fi almost everywhere now so finding a connection shouldn't be hard. The wifi is fast a reliable on this phone, and it's just so convenient.Screen:The screen is terrific for such a budget phone. The resolution isn't crazy high, but it's very crisp and easy to read. As far as I know, there is no option to adjust the brightness of the screen, but that's not a big problem because the brightness is perfect for all situation. Even in sunlight, the screen is remarkably readable.Battery Life:I only go the phone yesterday, so I really don't know about the battery life. According to other websites, however, it has 7 hours or talk time. Not impressive, but still pretty good. It also depends on if your wi-fi is turned on and stuff like that.UI (Interface):This phone uses the Nokia S40 use interface. This interface is pleasantly simple, yet has all the features you need. There are a few apps that come preloaded onto the phone, but whenever I try to go to the OVI Store, it says this phone is not compatible. This might be an issue with the browser or maybe the phone just ISN'T supported. But that shouldn't be too much of a problem because people shouldn't buy this phone expecting an iPhone. The phone also gives you easy access to your favorite social networks from the homescreen, which I find a great feature paired with the included wi-fi (I don't have a data plan).QWERTY Keyboard:The keyboard is perfect. The keys may a little small and intimidating, but even for those of us who have thick fingers, typing will become a breeze. The keys are stiff enough to prevent accidental presses, but at the same time, they are easy to press. Perfect combination, eh? Also, I've noticed that on a lot of phones, the keys make a loud *click* noise when they're pressed. This phone barely even makes a noise. I would have to say that the navigation pad above the QWERTY keyboard is a little ""loud"" at first, especially the directional pad, but you soon get used to it.Text Messaging:I couldn't be happier with the texting experience on this phone. The messages are displayed in a conversational manner for each contact, and you can even assign the dedicated e-mail key to go to the conversations (texting) screen. I find this really helpful because it let's me keep track of who I was talking to and what I was talking to them about.Email:The email on this phone is good. The ""app"" takes about 6 seconds to load up after you press ""Mail"" in the menu, but then it's pretty quick. You can have multiple accounts, and all you have to input is you username and password. The phone does the rest, so no need to find the server addresses and ports or whatever you need. I've never really had email on a phone, but I must say it's very convenient.Internet Browser:There are 2 internet browsers that I'm aware of. I have no idea what the default first one is called, but the second one is Opera Mini.

"Nokia E51 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, MP3/Video Player, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black Steel)","Nokia","269.1","2","I bought this Nokia thinking it has a great feature set and I will admit that on paper it does, however when you get to using it that the problems start.Screen... I have a Blackberry for work and had a SonyEricsson for personal use; they have been banging around in my pockets along with my keys for close to a year now without a single problem or scratch. After half a day in that same pocket with the blackberry and keys the Nokia's screen is already scratched. This of course means they skimped another $1 on the coating for the screen and we all know the result.Features...I chose this phone because I thought I'd be able to use it with Skype anywhere I had a wifi connection and sometimes I can, but for the most part the reception is shaky at best when and only when it connects correctly and doesn't kick me off the network. I also had my SE connected to my car (Audi A4) via Bluetooth with a great function that let me read my phonebook from my car nav screen. The Nokia can't do it!! This really upset me so I did some research and discovered that Nokia did not include the complete Bluetooth stack in the phone and will not update this in the future. One would think that adding another small bit of software to create a better product would be a good investment, but apparently Nokia thinks differently.Battery Life...The battery lasts for ages and I will admit they did a great job with it. There is one thing about charging the phone that I do have a gripe with. This phone cannot be charged via USB. It has the connector for mini USB, but its only for data, a separate plug is needed to charge the phone. This of course means carrying around more cables. yay.Camera...The SE w810i I had also had a 2megapixel camera, but it had things like Macro and Autofocus so even though this phone has a 2 megapixel camera good luck using it without any kind of options or functions. I tried taking a picture of text as I often did with the SE to save some time and the hassle of pen and paper, now I can't even do that because this phone can't focus.Reception...The reception is great BUT THIS PHONE IS NOT 3G!!!!!!! Yes it is 3G in EUROPE, but ATT uses the 1900 UMTS frequency in the USA for 3G so it will not work with 3G in the USA. Goodbye blazing fast speeds when there is no WIFI.I had a Nokia a Long time ago and though it might be time to give it another try, but I think I'll wait another 5 years to try them again.","19","helpful"
"Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)","Nokia","193.5","5","I've been searching for a solid business smart phone for some time. The key criteria was first and foremost solid phone reception in an area that can have spotty coverage due to many hills plus strong battery life. I also needed solid syncing capability to my work calendar (Oracle Calendar), a very strong web browsing experience, and well designed contacts and call management. I must say that the Nokia e71 has excelled in each of these areas and the battery life is amazing (2 days solid with no charging). The main screen (Home Screen) is very well designed and more customizable than any other smart phone I have seen including the iPhone (which I also like very much). The extent to which this phone and its menu options can be tailored to meet your unique needs is impressive. The keyboard is small but eminently usable and the weight and thinness of this phone is incredible. This is one phone that I carry in a pouch in my pocket and not on my belt -- which is a first. The speaker phone is very decent ... not as strong as a Blackberry I used previously ... but respectful. And the call clarity and reception is a major plus for this phone. I loved my iPhone but dropped calls more than I would have preferred. Not so with this phone ... I've gotten consistently good reception. The included web browser is very usable and Opera Mini is also excellent (a free download). The email client on this phone -- which I use for IMAP4 -- is decent but I find it can occasionally be slow in updating or syncing with my corporate e-mail. Also, the calendar sync works well, but there is no auto-sync capability (you have to initiate the sync directly although that's easily done). Not a deal killer for me, but the email functionality needs some further refinement (perhaps a firmware update is coming on this one) and Nokia really does need to add an autosync feature for the syncml client so it can for example run once in the morning and once in the evening without user intervention to keep your phone's calendar in sync with the office. But in the end, there is no perfect smart phone ... but this seems to me to be one of the most solid one's out there based on my own extensive research and hands on testing. Excellent build quality, very rich functionality, and a reliable phone connection. I'm well satisfied. Nokia seems to have a winner here and if you have a Mac, the sync support to the Mac platform is an added plus. Good luck in your search for the perfect phone!","19","helpful"

"Nokia Lumia 1020 RM-877 32GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 41MP Camera - White (International Version)","Nokia","199.99","5","This phone is a year old and other than the camera, has internals that are about 2 years old. That said, this thing is awesome. I challenge you to buy a two-year old Android phone, put the newest version of Android on it, and not throw it in a lake within a week. I have owned a LOT of cheap Android devices in the past, some which I have paid as much as I paid for this phone. They all we're slow and sluggish, and within a few months, we're unusable. That has not been my experience with Windows Phone. Before buying this 1020, I had a Nokia 521. 1 GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM. Android or iOS would come to a screeching halt if you those low specs at it. Windows Phone flys on such low specs. I had the 521 for a year, and now it's being used as a dedicated game system for the kids running graphically intense racing games. Still doing great.So, when you put Windows Phone on decent specs, then look out. I am having one hell of a pleasant experience with this phone. Smooth as butter, even with ""older"" specs. I point this out, because if you are like me, and came from the Android world, you know you don't want to spend this kind of change on old specs. You shouldn't have these concerns with this phone. Turned it on, and it updated to the newest WP 8.1, which is running blazing fast. No lag. None. Everything is smooth.The camera. Holy cow. Once you figure it out, it's amazing. Here is the trick, though. The camera saves two images, a 38 MP image and a 5 MP image processed from the bigger one. The screen shows the 5 MP, so if you pinch to zoom in, it won't look very good. You need to open the image in Nokia Creative Studio and reframe. You can then zoom in on that flea sitting on your dog and it's crystal clear. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but not much. I took a picture of a can of soda that was sitting across the room, and I could zoom in later and clearly read the nutrition information on the side of the can. The xenon flash means no blur with motion. It freezes the motion. This is great if your like me and have small children that won't sit still for a picture. It is a little slow shot to shot. The app pops up fast, but if you want to take 10 shots in 10 seconds, then no go. It takes time to process that 38 MP image. I don't find it to be a problem, since the xenon flash prevent blurring so I get a great shot the first time. Very happy with the camera.As far as apps, I have all the apps I need. Plus, I've found some apps that are windows exclusive that blow away iOS or Android. I can download maps and use GPS with no data service. This was VERY useful when I went to Argentina. No data, but I had the country maps downloaded, so the cab drivers had a tough time ripping me off. Mix Radio lets you make playlists based on artists or genres, like Pandora. The difference is I can take up to 16 hours of playlists offline with Mix Radio and no ads. That means I listen to great ""streaming"" music in my car without using a single MB of data. These are awesome features with the metered data plans you get with AT&T. All the other big things are there. Facebook. Twitter. Fitbit. Whatever. OneDrive is awesome. Dropbox is downgrading me to 2 GB since my old Samsung 2 yr promotion is over. I didn't know what I would do, but now I have 18 FREE GB with OneDrive. Plus, when I get a Office365 subscription, I'll get a free 1 TB. 1 TB AND Office for less than a Dropbox upgrade.I worry about buying phones from 3rd parties on Amazon. I don't want my phone to come in Korean or Czech. I want a US version with US frequency bands, because I live in the US. Joycells ships a brand new, unopened, unsealed Nokia Lumia 1020 locked to AT&T. I have not seen this phone anywhere for $299. It's hard to find a USED 1020 on ebay for that price. And... You actually get a new phone. Good deal. I did 1 day shipping for $3.99 and had it the next day. Thanks Amazon. Popped in an AT&T SIM card, and it just worked. 4G LTE running fast. It is NOT unlocked, but it isn't advertised as such. I have AT&T so it's no problem. In 6 months, they'll unlock it for me.Do not buy this phone through Amazon Mobile with a contract. If you do, you'll pay att $99 for the phone, $40 activation fee, and an extra $15 per month minimum for 2 years. Do the math. That's $500 vs. $299. I think Amazon Mobile will set you up for $0.01, but you still pay activation and the extra $15 per month. Still $100 more in the end. Next is worse. Over 24 months you'll pay the full retail price of $600. That's twice as much. You're better off putting the thing on an Amazon credit card and paying ridiculous interest over 2 years than that deal.","19","helpful"

"Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Red","Nokia","149.35","5","I wanted Windows OS and I had to decide between an HTC 8X (available with T-Mobile) and an unlocked 920 (that I could use with T-Mobile without switching to AT&T).I bought the unlocked 920, I'm playing with it for more then few weeks now, and every time I touch this phone it simply doesn't stop to amaze me. Maybe 8X would have been good too (same OS), but now I have a 920 and really love it. Video and picture quality are without any doubt the best I've ever seen in any phone.

"Nokia 3710 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)","Nokia","269.1","5","This is a wonderfully designed phone for people who don't have a data plan and don't want one. It gets great reception, makes clear calls and will do texting if you so desire. The main menu is super user friendly and it has some useful built in apps. The GPS Maps and navigation are free and you don't have to access the wireless internet to use them. You can download them with your home computer over your home internet connection and transfer them to the phone with the Nokia Ovi software suite. The FM radio and MP3 player work well. This little unlocked phone is far better than anything AT&T is currently offering for people who are not interested in accessing the internet with their cell phones. The freedom from AT&T's locked phone software is a huge plus and greatly simplifies the phones menu navigation and ease of use. I put in the AT&T SIM, 4 GB of extra memory and the battery and the phone fired right up. Only minimal configuration was required to meet my particular desire to have the GPS function never access the internet and to run the network in GSM only mode to save battery life since I never access the 3G network. If you are not technically inclined you need not do anything and you will be no worse off than AT&T's locked phone default configuration. The setup menus are very user friendly. I had no problem removing the back cover as some other comments suggested. The camera is nothing special and lacks auto focus but does have a flash. It is about equivalent in picture quality to a throw away snap shot camera. I highly recommend this phone to any non data cell phone user.","20","helpful"

"Nokia C2-01.5 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Music and Video Player--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)","Nokia","98","2","First, I love this phone;It was everything I wanted, without all the ""smartphone"" junk and expense I wouldn't use. I didn't want to get stuck in another 2 yr contract, and have to buy a data plan with AT&T, just because I had to have a new phone. I researced for weeks, with no cell phone, ended up buying a gophone, LG Encore (touchscreen horror story!) and using it for 2 weeks before I settled on this phone. So I didn't just jump into a new phone. This phone is great as far as sound, dialing, texting, if ALL you want is a simple phone; If that was all, I'd give it 5 stars, so if you want to get a good, plain phone, at this price, go for it. You can stop reading now. However, if you want a phone you can use to take and then send or ever receive multimedia messages, keep looking. The camera, although a 3.2 mp takes grainy, blurry pictures. My biggest issue with the phone is that I can't ever receive or send anything except text messages. Forget the cute Christmas pics I was supposed to have gotten from friends and relatives! I had the phone for about 3 weeks before deciding there must be a problem, since I had more than 1 person ask what I thought of the pics they had sent! This phone IS NOT UNLOCKED to receive multimedia (mms)messages. Believe me, I have tried! I have spent literally hours on the phone with AT&T tech people over the last 3 days, trying to see if it could be set to receive mms. Every tech rep was extremely helpful and made calls, searched the web, and did all they could to try and help. After the first 2 days of working to find the problem, we even decided to return the phone and get another one (Amazon advertises the phone as unlocked for mms as well as web access). I received the new phone yesterday, and after letting it fully charge, went through the whole ordeal of set-up again. Then spent another hour on the phone with a tech, same thing. This phone WILL NOT accept, or send, multimedia messages, and you CANNOT access the web (though it is supposed to be unlocked to do that and is advertised as such), IF you use AT&T services (I can't speak for other carriers), be aware this will not work for you. One last thought, since I'm sure many of us might assume it is AT&T's fault, since this is not their phone maybe they just don't want to put in the codes needed. I also had a conference call with Nokia. The rep I spoke to was very rude and refused to help or assume any responsibility from Nokia. I had called Nokia and been told to have the AT&T tech person do a conf call with me and they would be able to help. When I got a tech person on the phone and called Nokia back, their rep was unbelievably rude and a huge waste of time. Nokia refused to help at all. I now have to either keep a ""dumbed down"" phone, or go through the process of trying to find a good phone all over again! So, buyer be aware!","20","helpful"

"Nokia X3-02 Factory Unlocked Touch and Type GSM Phone - Dark Metal (International Version) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","Nokia","264.1","4","Pretty sharp, especially for such a small phone (as compared to today's standards for touch screen displays). Part of me wonders why I feel like I need the physical keys - my cell phone experience might be more enjoyable if I opted for a full touchscreen - but in the end, I'm weird and I love having the physical keys, even though it's t9 entry and not qwerty. Anyway. If you don't want to read this all: Low priced phone with plenty of features, not a true smart phone but has enough to keep most happy, provided that you have small hands and do not require the extreme polish and power of the highest end phones.Note: I have not set this phone up with a plan yet, so I cannot comment as to call quality and such. I will comment on everything else that I have experienced.Handset has a solid, polished feel. Lightweight but not flimsy. Smallish unit, not for people with sausage fingers, fine for me. Size of display is respectable, considering the size and configuration of the device. Keys are enjoybly clicky. Clean, attractive design. I will say that I knew it was a small phone, but I hoped it would be slightly bigger. At least it fits into any pocket or armband!The layout is a simple candybar, but hybrid style: physical keys plus touchscreen, no slide out. An odd combo or a match made in heaven, depending on who you ask. I like it, it's one of the main reasons I purchased it. On the negative side, it totally contributes to the smaller size of the display.Battery cover is metal. A little tricky to remove sometimes (you have to simultaneously press two rather small buttons at either side of the bottom part of the phone to release the cover), but just enough so that it should never come off on its own in your pocket or wherever. MicroSD slot is unobstructed by the battery, which is convenient (see power up comments!). Cover is easy to close, you just have to make sure you get both sides at the bottom fully snapped in, or you may welcome dust and dirt inside.Headphone jack is standard 3.5mm. A must, far as I'm concerned. From left to right as you view the face of the handset, this jack is at the top, next to the micro usb port and the charger jack. To sum it up, physically, this phone is attractive and user friendly for individuals with accurate and slender fingers/small hands.Power on the handset and...of wait, IF YOU HAVE THE MICROSD CARD ALREADY INSERTED, half the time, the screen flashes and the handset refuses to come on. If this happens to you, no worries, I've figured it out. The phone does not like coming on with the microSD card inserted, sometimes. Weird, annoying, probably enough right there to warrant a replacement if you're under warranty, but it's endurable, check it out: if this happens to you, remove the battery cover and press the microSD card to release it, and you will be able to power on your phone. Then, press the microSd card back in and all is well. Everything is peachy keen once the phone is on. When turned on, it comes to a standard home screen which is of course configurable. I like that you click the time to get to the alarm clock, and I'm sure almost every phone in the world does this, but I love being able to set any sound that you record (or video, I think) as your wake up call (or ringer). Anyway, you can set the home screen as you like, putting whatever you want in a set number of spots arranged a la typical nokia home screen format, or going with the grid display. Definitely makes things more convenient for the individual user depending on what you use the most. I have mine set with my music and radio at the bottom, WLAN search above that, time and calendar above that, and fav contacts above that. Whatever you do, though, what you want is never more than a couple touches away.The vibration feedback is quick and just enough feedback, and you can of course turn it off to save power. Accuracy of the touchscreen sometimes seems off, but again, it's a smallish display. Also, you can calibrate it, of course, and that does help if you happen to have certain patterns in how you place your touches (i.e. if you tend to go low). That helped in my case. Also, compared to other touchscreens, you will sometimes kind of have to actually press it, as a light touch doesn't always do the trick. Swiping across the screen makes everything move as it seems it should, just make sure your initial touch is firm enough (note: I recently downloaded facebook for the device, which is different than how fb operates if you just go into it from the browser, and in this version, screen swipes barely move the screen. Weird. But visually, it's still more enjoyable than the stripped down standard browser version).Display is sharp, clear. It's not an HD tv, though, in case that's what you're expecting. Decent view in the sun, not amazing, as with most phones.You can play with this phone quite a bit without having a voice plan. I use my home's wi-fi to access the internet, which is a somewhat limited and of course small version thereof, but totally useable. Not a bit deal for someone like me who doesn't play on the internet much. Videos are surisingly enjoyable, in my opinion - clear enough visually, good sound, no delays or jumpiness that I've experienced yet, though I'm sure especially high traffic sites and/or longer vids would cause that. With videos, you can opt for ""full screen"" (horizontal) mode, which of course helps.5mp camera, without flash. Slight shutter delay, which is annoying, and I think the delay is what led to most of my early pictures blurry, since I get impatient and move. But once you are able to chill out for a couple seconds, you can get pretty good pics, as long as the subject is more than a foot away and the lighting is ok. I am somewhat surprised to say that even relatively low light pictures aren't horrible...but again, there has to be some amount of light, since there's no flash. Pictures look less amazing on the phone than they do when uploaded onto your pc, as is generally the case with cameras and camera phones (this is because the display is a lower resolution than the actual picture). I'm surprised at how many people don't realize this!The music player is pretty nice. You might have some difficulties synching up from Windows Media Player or whatever (via usb), but once I decided to just synch to my microSD directly (with the adapter to the reguar size of an SD card), it was a snap. Playlists apparently don't tranfer, however. At least not from Media Player. When I synched, it pulled EVERYTHING onto the microSD card, including my wife's (no offense) awful music. Good thing I opted for the 16GB microSD card. :) Anyway, creating and managing playlists from the handset is a breeze. The one thing I haven't quite fugured out is if there is a way to remove songs from a playlist that is as easy as adding them. I haven't spent much time on this yet, but it doesn't appear that it works as easily in both directions, which may mean that you would be better off starting a playlist over if you accidentally put the smae song in twice, as I did. Or, just skip it when it comes on the 2nd time!FM radio included. Cool. Have to have headphones inserted, though - they act as antenna. And I believe there are apps available if you want to listen to practically any radio station available in the world.Sound quality is good. Sound distortion with external speakers at highest levels, duh. Not a problem with the headphones though. There seems to be a pretty low limit on max volume, compared to what I expected. It's plenty loud enough for me, even when I use it while excercising, but you may be disappointed if you are someone who likes to blast your headphones so loud that your neighbors can hear it. I recommend special earbuds like yurbuds (seriously, look these up) or something if you find the headphone volume too low for you. Equalizer is a nice touch.The included games are kind of lame. I mean the memory games and such are very simplistic but fun for dorks like me, whereas what you'd think would be the ""fun"" games, like the breakdancing one, sucks. Guitar Hero is a nice included game, sort of, but trying to move quickly and accurately on this size of display is difficult. Whatever, I barely play the games anyway. You can download many more games and apps from the ovi store.Summary: I sort of love the handset, physically. It's just about perfect for me, ergonomically, and everything is easy to use in general. The power on/microSD conflict issue can be really annoying if you are in the habit of turning on your phone while on the go, but I can probably manage, or see about an exchange. I know that I signed my our fate when going for a phone with this type of hybrid layout, but the screen could stand to be slightly bigger. Also, this phone is so slim and small, they might have done better with the physical keys on a slide out. Nokia has models like that, but to me, they were not as attractive as the x3-02. Overall grade: B.","20","helpful"
"Nokia - Touch and Type X3-02 White Silver WiFi Unlocked 3G Cell Phone","Nokia","142.13","4","Many people have commented on the good quality of the sound of this phone. (which was the main reason I purchased it)Its size and keypad design are good for normal use. ( I have large hands and find it not difficult) I find myself searching for the 0 though, but I still like the design.The overall feel and design of the phone are very impressive. It doesnt look cheap.The camera is better than I expected (I wasnt expecting much).The touch screen is ok. It is a little tough to get used to. Initially I turned off the haptic feedback vibration in hopes to preserve battery, but I found that it helps with navigating the touch screen. Though the proximity sensor doesn't always work when making a call, so my ear will set off the screen and get a vibration sometimes.Battery life is pretty good (I charge maybe once a week with moderate use).I use this phone as pay-per-use, and for that I would say it is excellent.If you are expecting this to be a smartphone, you will be thoroughly disappointed.However, if you want a relatively cheap high quality unlocked phone to use as a 'phone', I would highly recommend this.","21","helpful"

"Nokia C2-01.5 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Music and Video Player--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)","Nokia","98","5","Nokia C2-01 Unlocked GSM cell phone (Quad-band and 3G)I was looking for an unlocked quad-band GSM cell phone for use while traveling abroad. The C2-01 is priced the same as some of Nokia's other smartphones that had a full keyboard (Blackberry style) but the C2-01 was the only one in-stock at the time. I wasn't expecting a whole lot after reading numerous reviews of other unlocked cellphones purchased via Amazon that yielded used/refurbished phones or phones that weren't unlocked.I was pleasantly surprised when the package arrived and my C2-01 was brand spanking new from the factory, complete with a NOKIA factory seal on the box. The battery was new, and the phone was in excellent condition. I was up and running within minutes, and fully charged the battery. I threw in a SIM card from another AT&T phone and it was immediately working, no PIN or unlock requests, nothing. It immediately recognized the AT&T SIM card and logged onto the network. I was unable to use the Internet or browse websites though, since I couldn't figure out how to change the access points properly. Even if I figured out how to access the internet, the C2-01 is ill-suited for browsing. The keypad is circa-2001 and the screen is circa-2001. It is very easy to use for phone calls and text messages (albeit slow due to the keypad design), and has MP3 audio capabilities.The micro-USB port allows you to charge the phone as well as access data. The AC adapter works in 120V AC and 240V AC outlets. A SIM card from China Unicom was inserted into the phone while in China, and it immediately recognized the carrier and changed the language to Chinese. The text and menu were in Chinese, this is great if you can read the language while traveling. But this is not so great when you can't read Chinese and just wanted a local prepaid SIM card to use while visiting! However, the simplicity and ease of use made the C2-01 truly worthwhile as a travel phone. The fact it can be used anywhere in the world (quad-band GSM and international 3G) makes it extremely versatile. The long battery life and simple interface for making/receiving phone calls are just icing on the cake!Overall: 4/5 stars. Antiquated keypad and tiny non-touch screen remind me of the late 1990s/early 2000s Nokia cellphones. The saving grace: long battery life, and automatic recognition of prepaid SIM cards makes for a perfect travel phone that can be used almost anywhere in the world.UPDATE: I figured out how to set it up for Internet access and as I suspected, the interface is ill-suited for web browsing let alone modern apps.","21","helpful"

"Nokia E6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, and 8 MP Camera - Silver","Nokia","269.1","4","I've been on the smartphone band wagon from the beginning. I have used devices from every platform, and I have a high bar for satisfaction. The Nokia E6 does not completely satisfy me, but it does what I need and does it well.I really became tired of toys posing as phones. How many of you are sick of smart phones which fail the basic premise of being a phone? I know I am and that's what brought me back to Nokia. Simply put, Nokia makes the best phones.There's a myriad of criticisms I could throw at Nokia, more specifically Symbian. But despite it's short comings, it still manages to offer a compelling device in the E6. Any criticisms you read about the E6's email handling are absolutely true. It's rubbish. However, I have found ProfiMail which brings the power of desktop email clients to the mobile platform better than anything else. Its UI is questionable, but it's an excellent email client. I've never seen a client that handles IMAP boxes this well with incredibly fast and accurate searching. So if you're considering the E6 just go ahead and factor in the $24.99 to include ProfiMail in the price.Beyond that, all I have to say is VoIP. The E6 is a powerful SIP/VoIP device. This along with it's penta-band antennae/tuner make this an invaluable tool for the globe trotters out there. It's kinda painful to set up, but once you do you can have nearly free VoIP international calling in your hands.The other ""amazing"" aspect of this device is the battery life. With moderate use I need to charge my phone once every 3 days. Now you can carelessly install/configure software to suck your battery dry, but if you're conservative with the configuration you can have quick access to data intense applications and ""amazing"" battery life. I say ""amazing"" because the current standard for smartphones these days seems to be around 12 hours of moderate usage.Additionally, the bluetooth stack on this device is so much more advanced than anything out there. It's Bluetooth 3.0 and supports these profiles: A2DP, AVRCP, BIP, DUN, FTP, GAP, GAVDP, GOEP, HFP, HSP, OPP, PBAP, SAP, SDP, SPP. It's the only phone I've had that I could get to work with AcuraLink (Acura's in car messaging system). I know some others have mentioned issues with Bluetooth on this device, but my experience has been flawless.I have had problems with the E6, but they are on par with problems I've had with every single smartphone I've ever used (more than 30 different devices). The software is not perfect. It will occasionally lock up. You will have to reboot the device when this happens. I recommend being judicious with 3rd party software as this seems to be the root of most of those type of woes.Overall I'm considering purchasing a backup E6 to have when this device is lost/damaged/worn out. That's how much I'm appreciating this phone. I would also like to hedge my bets on Nokia's brain dead corporate direction in moving to the Windows mobile platform (Did the CEO even look at the amazing N9 before canning it?). If you keep your expectations reasonable and really want a smartphone that excels at being a phone, then you really can't go wrong with the E6.","21","helpful"
"Nokia E7-00 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, 8 MP Camera--U.S. Version with Warranty (Blue)","Nokia","269.1","5","I'm writing this review from the perspective of someone who's had a Nokia epiphany with the E71 (some time ago) and a somewhat muted (at least, at first) yet ever-growing blast with the E72.Essentially, the jump from a non-touch ~2"" screen to a truly gorgeous 4"" AMOLED touch screen (and the wonderful freedom it allows for Symbian to finally let loose) is just short of life-changing, and thus, if you're making the leap into the touch screen arena for the first time, you can expect to be just as -- if not more -- blown away as I am now. For those of you who've been playing with touch screens for ages now, even I can admit (and, so far, a good number of iPhone and various Android users, too) that this screen's size and brilliance is definitely at or near the top.One more thing before I cover a few, select details: I had heard that Nokia's earlier ventures into the touch screen market didn't quite measure up to the fast, responsive, and flowy moves of iOS (e.g. N97, X6). This was a major worry, because I just couldn't imagine anything worse than being stuck with a physical button-less screen that jolted and froze as I poked around the Symbian interface. However, due to the difficulty in finding independent retailers that had any of the newest models of touch screen Nokias available for demos, I took a very cautious step out, bought the E7, and was most pleasantly surprised! It's a breeze, and even after the wonder of the screen's beauty wares off, the sensitivity, responsiveness, and class (yes, it's classy) will continue to make you ponder how Nokia's E7 could possibly still even have one of the best mobile keyboards ever built!! It's overwhelming...Now, time to be short and sweet and name just a few ups and downs:- The fact that Nokia managed to squeeze the keyboard and screen into a mobile device whose hardware (as usual) is impeccable and truly some of the best Nokia's ever put together (which is saying something, trust me), and whose form factor is as fresh, slim, and eye-catching as a concept phone that's come out 6 months too early, is just unheard of in today's somewhat mundane mobile marketplace. And plus, the whole brick-like ""communicator"" style seemed to be out, but now Nokia has given it more than enough new and improved life to make the E7 also an incredibly unique piece. Tired of having to come up with new tricks and apps (what is that one.. Swype?) to type on a virtual, touch keyboard...and dealing with an unfortunately steep learning curve (which many times doesn't have a top)? Well, why don't I just pop up my screen to this curiously comfortable 30 degree angle and type on a real keyboard! How refreshing...- As always, phone's tend to seem they could use a bit more power. And, like any phone, I wouldn't complain if there was just a little more kick here as well. It's fast, but you'll notice just the tiniest inkling of lag when you're installing new programs (and, ofcourse, new software updates and whatnot, as mentioned by another reviewer here). I have to admit -- being used to Symbian -- I have become patient and understanding when my phones have seemed to freeze for a second or two when introducing new software to them, but it's not the end of the world.- Now that Nokia's officially jumping ship (or ""platform""....) to Microsoft's mobile OS, one would (reasonably) assume that Symbian's essentially dead in the water. This idea went through my head for a second, but I've put it behind me. First of all, I think Nokia's done a really good job with Symbian^3, and considering that I've only come onboard a few months after the E7's release, there've been a good handful of serious software updates, and I have had nearly zero problems at all with the OS thus far (with only a minor problem installing some updates to Ovi maps and the Symbian search: they'd download, but would continue to fail in installation...but nothing a restart of the phone couldn't fix ... which tends to be an easy and simple fix for most things when it comes to Symbian). Therefore, I have a good feeling that this switch to Microsoft's WP7 will not be much of a problem at all (considering the following Nokia has in the Symbian world), at least, not as much as what it will probably bring to the OviStore (which is also debatable). **UPDATE: Symbian ""Anna"" will be available for the E7, sometime soon (as of April '11)**- Also about Symbian: for those of you who know the OS, I think Symbian^3 on the E7 will be a lot of fun; although I'm definitely used to the ins and outs (however, I'm surely not a pro), I still had to do a little internet research for the usual hidden tips and tricks, and some basic how-to. Those who know Symbian will know what I'm talking about. Symbian isn't about dumbing things down so that everything is as clear as day (and simultaneously taking the customization and uniqueness to the chopping block). There is no one place for all your phone's preferences, for instance. So if you can't find how to change something, don't give up. It's part of the fun and once you figure it out, it'll slowly all make sense, and a wonderful map of a world known as Symbian^3 will slowly form into a coherent, simple, straight-forward and truly logical OS.I'm still discovering plenty on the E7, and I'm still doing double takes at it's distinctive elegance, refinement, and true artistry, as it sits on my table with it's slightly tilted, thin, brilliant face looking up at me over a streamlined keyboard and award-worthy body. If you have yet to jump into the world of Nokia, this is the top of the top and one hell of a place to dive in.

I needed an all purpose phone for use in corporate (read that as Microsoft Exchange) environment.While I found the iPhone to be otherwise great, I had some major issues with it - Lack of real Keyboard just does not work well for lots of email/sms typing. Next the Exchange support was too late, too little (Exchange Account did not work for me ever and Calendar/Reminders was a problem when using Exchange over IMAP), Battery life was unbearably bad, and lastly the iPhone did not support Bluetooth stereo headphones.So I tried Blackberry Bold - only to find out that the browser on it was not anywhere near as good as the iPhone but the real problem was that it needed a BlackBerry Data plan before it could do anything - no mails, no Internet even when connected to Wi-Fi - and my corporate data plan does not include BlackBerry Data Plan - Bummer!Enter Nokia E71 - I am happy to report it has solved all my problems. The browser on this phone is based on the same WebKit engine that Apple uses in Mobile Safari. I found website compatibility to be excellent. Most importantly however, it comes with Flash! Most flash sites work well - but not all, as this is a Flash lite version. There is also a Youtube client freely available that works amazingly well.Battery life on this phone is really great compared to the iPhone or any other smart phone - I can easily get through a heavy-use day (3G calling, Some music over bluetooth, Always on Exchange Sync) and even go for another day with lighter use.If you use Exchange for email - you will find the E71 does Exchange very well. Setup was very straight forward, I could customize the sync schedule to be always on during working hours and every 1 hour off-peak. The newest version of the Nokia Mail for Exchange Application is very stable and functional. It includes a Company Directory Client which lets you quickly search for your colleagues to find their email/phone information. Meeting reminders work very well - Exchange server calendar is synced to your phone and so all your meeting reminders are available right on the home screen - very convenient. It also supports regular GMail over IMAP.The real keyboard on this thin little phone is very usable - you almost want to keep typing! I rarely mistype. There is auto completion which works OK for most part and is actually useful.Call quality is great - very rarely I had dropped calls, but they were due to ""Network Busy"" errors on AT&T's part and happened after 2 hours of talk - so I can't really blame the phone for it.Media - The phone continues to do great on this front. I was able to pop in my 4Gb micro SD card to make enough space for all my music and podcasts. It plays MP3s/AAC and most other routinely used formats. All of your music is available automatically for setting as ring tones or other tones (reminders/alarm etc.). It has a very functional Podcast client built-in - I was able to subscribe to all of my favorite podcasts and it automatically updated/downloaded the episodes as and when they became available. Stereo bluetooth support is great - it allows to listen to music or podcasts while driving or while in the Gym. This was the only phone that played lots of music over bluetooth without crashing.The camera on this phone is 3.2MP and so it produces better quality pictures but I found a blue hue on the pictures initially - that was fixed with the latest software update from Nokia and now the pictures are great.Speaking of which - if you buy one, do yourself a favor and download the Nokia PC Suite Application (Windows only -works with Vista/x64) and run the phone software update before using the phone. This way you will get all the bug fixes and enhancements for the Phone without losing any data or setup. This is one area I wish Nokia improved - the upgrade process does not automatically preserve your data/settings/applications that are on your phone (as opposed to on the MicroSD card) - it should just put your phone back where it was before the upgrade and do it all automatically.Lastly the GPS - it works well. It was able to connect to the satellites and determine my position even indoors! Download the Google Maps application for free and you have a very usable GPS.If you are OK with having this phone locked down to AT&T network for a 2yr contract - I have heard that AT&T is bringing a later version of this phone for under $100 - so keep an eye.","21","helpful"

Also, I am very computer savvy person (if you know what I mean...)It is fast smooth and certainly feels like a great phone! The main downsides are that its an international version (thus does not work with 4G or LTE or 3G for that fact) but it still works with 2G (note: I use T-Mobile). Now I know there is a variant of a United States model of this phone which is called the RM-995 model version and that is another $100 more than this one (I bought this one for $350). Now I know its not fair to judge a phone because of its these kinds of limitation but the loss of a ""star"" is because of the lack of support from the company when I asked it some simple questions (such as does this work for T-Mobile and does 4G/LTE/3G work)...but over all it is an awesome phone and I do not regret my decision buying this phone!","22","helpful"

"Nokia Lumia 1320 Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone w/ Microsoft Windows 8 - Orange (No Warranty)","Nokia","99.99","4","Well first I am a person who makes a review after a good couple of weeks of using it and in this case it was well over a couple of months. Also, I am very computer savvy person (if you know what I mean...)It is fast smooth and certainly feels like a great phone! The main downsides are that its an international version (thus does not work with 4G or LTE or 3G for that fact) but it still works with 2G (note: I use T-Mobile). Now I know there is a variant of a United States model of this phone which is called the RM-995 model version and that is another $100 more than this one (I bought this one for $350). Now I know its not fair to judge a phone because of its these kinds of limitation but the loss of a ""star"" is because of the lack of support from the company when I asked it some simple questions (such as does this work for T-Mobile and does 4G/LTE/3G work)...but over all it is an awesome phone and I do not regret my decision buying this phone!","22","helpful"

"Nokia N95-4 8 GB Unlocked Phone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, and Media Player--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)","Nokia","177.4","3","I ordered this a few weeks ago and was really excited about receiving it. Coincidentally the day before my N95-4 arrived, Nokia released a new firmware update so the first thing I did was update the software on my N95-4 to the latest version.During the update process I noticed the USB port on the phone itself seemed loose but thought nothing of it. After the update was done I began to use the phone and I ended up returning it to Amazon the next day! You've seen all the positive reviews, so I won't rehash that, but here are why I returned it:- The USB port on my N95-4 was extremely loose or broken. You had to apply a lot of pressure and push the cable in and then not touch it for it to stay connected. It was so loose that a breeze from the window could disconnect the device from the PC. I tried several USB cables, computers/ports with no success.- The USB transfer speed is HORRIFIC for a device that comes with 8GB. It took almost 2.5 hours to transfer about 4GB of music to the device using Windows Media Player. Using mass storage mode is just as slow since this uses USB 2.0 Full-Speed (old spec) not USB 2.0 High-Speed (common today). No matter what people tell you this is absolutely frustrating and annoying over time, even if you don't transfer stuff much.- The slider on the phone is wobbly and whenever I pressed a button on the keypad it made a creaking sound that I don't expect from a $600 phone. It did not feel solid at all, at least not my N95-4- The overall size of the device is surprisingly small but the thing is as thick as a brick which makes it awkward to carry in your pant pocket or worse jeans pocket.- Even without really installing any apps on it the thing would randomly slow down and not respond to key presses and then just ""wake up"" all of a sudden it was bizarre.- Does not charge via USB. Not used to this so was annoying that you have to at times have both a USB cable and Nokia charger plugged in.I ended up getting a Nokia N78 (US 3G) that was just recently released and I'm extremely happy with it. It addresses most if not all of the issues I had with the N95-4 including fastest USB, fast CPU/responsive, excellent build quality.I would recommend looking at the N78 or the upcoming N96 (successor to N95) over the N95-4.","22","helpful"

"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (Black)","Nokia","59.95","2","yea, so I took a chance with this phone. It had no reviews and Amazon was advertising it, so I said, ""what the heck, I can always return it."" It had everything I was looking for, quality camera, slide out QWERTY pad, touch screen and priced right. It has a nice touch screen, although, it sometimes took too long to realize whether I had the phone sideways and to change accordingly. Wasn't too impressed with the camera quality and there is a lower grade secondary camera if you want a personal picture. If you try to take a picture of yourself using the main camera, you'll have a hard time finding the button because there is not one on the side so you can easily snap a picture. I'm not very literate to the smart phone world, so bear with me. The QWERTY pad is great, I liked it. Overall the phone was okay, I could have stuck with it. But 4 days after purchase, the deal breaker came when I was losing calls because the ringtones preloaded to the phone stopped working. I didn't change anything about the settings or volume, they just stopped working. Nothing else seemed defective, so I don't know what happened.I took a leap of faith and it didn't pan out.

"Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)","Nokia","99.99","1","I hope Nokia pays a harsh price for what it has done.This phone should never have been released to the public. In fact, seeing as what the E71 was, this phone should never have been built. It reeks of cost cutting and business manager interference, where some moron MBA decided they knew what was the best way to bring this phone to market. This is the kind of phone that is a brand killer for any serious user, or any of the long-time Nokia users who know what the brand is supposed to stand for. This isnt one of the crappy little [...] phones they build for verizon because they have to. It's [...], top of the line, supposedly. And it's awful. A disgrace, so let me fill you in on why.First a few things, just so you know where Im coming from :1) Ive been a Nokia user for over a decade. Owned probably close to ten different phones. Always eagerly awaited the next one. I know the symbian s60 system pretty well, so my points below aren't coming from someone who doesn't yet understand the phone.2) My last phone was the E71, which Ive had since it was released. If you are an E71 user, and love that phone like I do, and were just hoping for a few tweaks to make it even better, well, you are going to be immensely disappointed with the E72.3) If you know nothing of the E71, (or even the E51, or E63) you should still read this, because even if that phone did not exist, the E72 in and of itself is a disaster.With that, I say : welcome to disappointment centrale! Wow.This phone ,the E72, unlocked US version, is like a distant [...] cousin or something to the E71. It sort of looks like the E71, but crappier. Right out of the box, feels crappier. Cheaper. You almost know it's made in china before you look at the box and confirm the ""telefono hecho en China"" (like they thought they could disguise it by writing it in Spanish. Morons.Let's talk build quality :So I thought, maybe it feels light and cheaply made because of the plastic, or because the battery isnt in yet. Maybe, right. Well, go to put the battery in - ick, here starts the bad experience with the phone. A flimsy little plastic tab that doesnt really release the battery cover properly. Plus they changed the neat design on the back of the E71 to something boring. And of course, as many have noticed, the back cover does not seat tightly. Yes, it's easier to open than the E71, but with the E71, you NEVER thought that one day the back cover would fail. And it didnt jiggle around. (Yes, this review is going downhill fast.) And the battery life isn't nearly as long as the E71.Next up, when you look at the back of the phone, you notice this THING jutting out. Ohhh, the camera, which is still only marginally better than the E71 (wont replace your canon, sorry), but now annoyingly bulbous and in the way. Why?On the side of the phone, the E71 had nice rubbery covers for the usb and memory card - this one, hard plastic, with the motorola style attachment that you can already see coming off months before it finally does. For those like me who want to use this as a modem via usb, but also put it in your pocket...ahh, yes, wait til that breaks off, then gets gunked up with pocket lint. Joy! But even better, try to open these things. You either have to have long fingernails, or use some sort of device to pry it open. Great. This pretty much assures you that you'll drop the phone one day trying to open up the usb tab.Speaker - incredibly tinny versus the E71. I'm embarrassed by the audio on this thing now. Sad. And they removed many of the really good audio clips, tones, etc, that were on the E71, and replaced them with garbage.Plug for earphones (headset) - go ahead and try it, then look at what you've done. Yup the plug seats at an angle, which just looks bad. Yes the top of the phone is sloped, but that doesn't mean the jack should go off at an angle.Four way key - very unpleasant to use (more below on this) - when you click it to the right, it sticks a bit, so if you next go to click to the left, it first clicks to get unstuck, then you can move left. Ridiculous. The center button, complete mush. No click sensation, just a mushy ""I think I pushed it in"" effect. Horrid. I can only hope that mine is defective, because this is completely unacceptable. But the sharp edge on the thing is by design. And it's awful to use. Did someone think that if they made the edge sharp, they'd force people to use the center optical scroll button?Main menu keys. This is probably more the fault of a stupid engineer, rather than an MBA. But who knows....on the E71, the four main keys are just that, four individual main keys. On the E71, they aren't. Perhaps it was for visual effect, but the key surfaces are all integrated, melding into a short stumpy capital ""I"" shape. And when you push one of them, like you often do with Nokia's operating system, you get a soft mushy response. No click. The bottom two have slightly more of a click feel, but the top two are mostly mush. FAIL.Now, granted the build quality is horrible compared to the E71, but the software, adios mios...the software.Business phone, right? Yup. E series. Enterprise. Well, this phone will put you out of business if you rely on it. In fact, you just cant rely on it.Email - with E71, you had two options, with your gmail and yahoo type accounts easily set up and very functional through Nokia Messaging. And your pop mail for work, like I have, could go through the other email system on the phone. Both worked fine, although the mail settings for the pop mail were not actually push, but rather every 5 minutes that it would check, so, no instantaneous email. With the e72, all the mail is routed through nokia messaging. That would actually be great, except one big thing. IT DOESNT WORK most of the time. Even when it does work, there is no option to view mail in HTML. Every single forking email you have to click once to open, then click again to view as HTML. And when you do so, what happens? Every email typically takes 10 to 30 seconds to load, if it loads at all. Disaster, unusable in its current form. Sometimes, when you open the program, and try to delete out your emails...they disappear with the (x) delete key on the side. Sometimes, they dont. Other times, a message that youve already viewed, try to open it again, nothing. NOT READY FOR PRIMETIME.Optical keypad - had to turn it off after a few days. Here is the problem...no matter how fast or slow or hard or soft you move your thumb across the area, it moves one item. This is NOT the functionality that makes a scrollball/trackball useful. Therefore, it serves almost no purpose. The only reason it is at all useful is that they redesigned the 4way pad around the optical key, with nice sharp edges, and made it really stiff too, so if you have to use it a lot, like I do, eventually it digs into your thumb and is quite annoying. FAIL.Web browsing - faster in terms of processing a page, and faster for scrolling around. But for some reason, many many times you click on the browser and it just sits, lifeless. You close it, start again, even when it says a decent signal with 3G. Nothing. Most of the time its unusable. Other times, you click on your bookmark...it starts going, then sure enough - invalid server name. Other times, you go to bookmark manager, and sometimes the bookmarks work, and other times, you click on them, and nothing. Plus, the menu items for additional browser menus are screwed up. You use the close button to close one of the window tabs, as you would on the E71, sometimes it closes that window, other times, it closes the whole web browser program and you have to start over. Added skyfire as a workaround, same problem with connectivity. Does not seem to want to pick up the ATT internet signal. FAIL.Now yes, many of these software issues will likely be resolved with a new firmware update. But when? If a person buys this phone, is already up and running with the E71, and thinks they are going to have a working phone, they are out of luck, so they are stuck with two phones. One, they just bought, but they cant use it because it's totally screwed up. And this is for the lucky people who have a phone with a build quality that, while cheap, isn't defective. I, on the other hand, am going to have to send mine back, because the fourway key is clearly screwy. But do you REALLY think I want to roll the dice with this phone again, given the potential for just receiving another phone with a different set of issues? No, I dont.This company can't be admonished enough for what they have done with this phone. Please please please, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. If you want to go down this road with Nokia, get the E71. The E72 should be discontinued, and we should all get refunds for this turd.3/3/10 update : finally a firmware update, 3 months after Ive owned the phone. Result - mail still broken, web browser still flawed, phone still an expensive piece of crap. And now it's [...] less than what I paid for it, and freebies thrown in. Can you say RIPOFF? Next update will be when I contact Nokia for a refund/exchange. And one more thing was pointed out on this phone in recent days, to my embarrassment : the earpiece, at the top of the phone, is crooked. How's that for a nice touch?","23","helpful"

"Nokia N9 Unlocked GSM Phone with 64 GB Internal Memory--International Version (Black)","Nokia","228.88","5","I've had this phone for a little over a week now, and I like it more and more everyday. There was an element of frustration at first...Gmail doesn't seem to want to play nice with Meego. Even some of the workarounds wouldn't help my mail and contacts to sync. Maps would freeze, Drive wouldn't load, and there was a few other hair-pulling frustrations.So why five stars? Well, most of my frustrations were fixed. Peruse the pages of the Meego forum and you'll find a lot of answers to tech problems. The N9 user community is very helpful. Also, the phone itself makes the tech woes dissipate from utter user-joy: the screen is incredible, a joy to look at. The N9 UI is the most intuitive touch screen experience I have ever used. The indicators on the lock screen are smart. I can't believe more smart phones don't use the same approach to indicators.I'm using my N9 on T-mobile, and while I seem to have fewer signal bars overall, I have fewer dropped calls. I can even talk on my N9 in my basement, which I couldn't do with my Sprint phone. Whether or not it's because T-mobile has a superior signal, or whether it's because the N9 has a better antenna -- I dunno.Some have said that the Ovi store has a paltry selection, but I've found everything I need and more. Sure, it's no Google play, but how many light saber and fart apps does a phone need?Admittedly, the battery is wanting. If you have a bunch of background apps running, it'll be toast in one day or less. But if you tweak your settings, you'll easily get at least two days with moderate usage.So, it's a phone I recommend. Even with all the baggage of the various tech problems (which are fixable), the poor battery, and the fact that Nokia will quit supporting it after 2014 (might need a new phone by 2015 anyway) it's still worth it. You know you have an awesome phone when the associates at T-mobile and best buy ogle it with ""wows"" and ""where did you get that?"" The N9 is like a pretty girl - she's worth fighting for.","23","helpful"

"NOKIA 301.2 FACTORY UNLOCKED QUADBAND 3G 850/1900 WORLD PHONE - BLACK","Nokia","269.1","5","An avid smartphone user for 6 years now, I bought this 301 this week to augment my Berry for those weekends and other times when I don't need the full pocket computer rolling. Battery life has been solid so far. Need to still do a full run-down test, yet the four bars keep staying on for a nice, long time. This review is a first impression.Don't let the 1990's look fool you, it's packing 3.5G (T-Mobile 4G for me) underneath this fully global, quad-band factory unlocked package. For not much more than a dual-band, I upgraded to the quad-band for some planned travel this coming year, and this should do the job quickly and happily. While it's nice to be ""unplugged"" from back home, it's a solid setup to be able to tie into web browsing and the email apps for Google, Yahoo, and Exchange built in. This won't replace your typical 4-6"" touch screen device for video consumption, however it loaded up my 32GB SD card that I use in my other device and played audio tracks within two minutes.I don't see this replacing my smartphone needs with work and such, however it has been a joy as a number two phone, ideal for those nights out when you are expecting a phone call/text and may want to hop on the web while waiting in line or whatnot. Bust out this 301 and pop onto the Xpress Browser or email your friend on their big screen pocket computer/phone and be prepared to see some shocked faces. This thing cooks. I wish that it would be sold in stores, however I'm a happy Amazon customer and this device seems to hit a nice medium between ""dumb phone"" and ""smart phone"" with sharp, near landline call quality and quick T9 typing.With the ability to quickly swap out the SIM from my Berry to this 301, I've got a fun and useful duo for the same price as compared to upgrading to popular 32 GB models of other smartphones, while using the latest iterations of some longtime players in this still, relatively new field.In sum, I'm impressed. I haven't had a Nokia since before my work BlackBerry days, yet I can tell you this, this is a great second SIM phone for those of us tethered to those devices and a solid telecommunication device, complete with up to date wireless tech baked in. If you're looking for a phone that does the talking thing with a clear voice, look no further.","25","helpful"

"Nokia 7705 Twist Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless) Works With Page Plus And Red Pocket cdma Verizon","Nokia","87.99","5","Let me start off by first saying this: The operating system that Verizon put on this phone, it is not bad itself, but it is awful looking. Horrible GUI, and a somewhat lackluster degree of organization. I think my Shih Tzu might have been able to create something more tasteful (ah, but I jest, she is merely a dog).Now, for the actual review. This phone is solid. I have dropped it, easily, thirty or more times, and it has yet to break! I was afraid that the pivoting design might be very delicate, but, having owned this phone for nearly four whole months, and having dropped, thrown, and scratched it a whole lot, it is still running strong.The only downside to the hardware is that the back doesn't really seem too well thought out, which is unusual for a Nokia device.Overall, but it, love it, show it to your friends, your mom, and everyone who walks by and says ""IS THAT A PHONE?!?!?"", and than proceeds to grab your phone and oogle and drool over it.

"NOKIA 301.2 FACTORY UNLOCKED QUADBAND 3G 850/1900 WORLD PHONE - BLACK","Nokia","269.1","5","I'm going to try to post the same review for two different Nokia ""feature"" phones, both of which I've bought through Amazon. First some context: I'm a geezer who likes dumb phones. I want a phone that will allow me to make and receive voice calls, and send and receive occasional text messages. That's it. No social networking, no automatic touch-and-pay capability, no spoken driving directions, etc. My previous phone, which I owned for about 8 years, was a Nokia 6030. Great phone!Recent phone calls and mailings from carrier AT&T warned me that my ""phone will no longer be supported"" after 11/30/14 in my service area in NorCal. I have a little technical background, but am not a phone geek. Had to do a bit of research on phone bandwidths, frequencies, and ""generations"". I wanted to understand why my old phone had finally reached end-of-life, and to pick a replacement that would provide similar capabilities and a long-as-possible future life. Hopefully this research will be helpful to others who face the same situation down the road.My old 6030 was a ""GSM-only"" phone. I had found on trips to Europe that it's also a U.S.-only phone. GSM is sometimes referred to as ""2G"", and it's this 2G function that AT&T is in the process of dismantling across the U.S., ending with final shutdown by 12/16. So I was looking for a 3G or better replacement phone.Both 2G and 3G generations of phones use different wireless frequencies in the U.S. (and Latin America) vs. the rest of the world (ROW). U.S. 3G runs 850 & 1900 MHz, with the lower ""more flexible"" frequency working better on insides of buildings. ROW 3G runs 900 & 2100 MHz.I initially chose the Nokia C2-01.5 for its small size (2-in. display), closest to my old 6030, and fitting nicely in my existing horizontal belt holster. However, early on I found the 3G reception indoors at home marginal, never actually dropping calls, but making normal conversations difficult, with audio gaps at both ends. Although the phone is represented as ""U.S. Version"", the phone's specific ""type"" is RM-721 (900/1900/2100), which omits the important U.S. inside-building frequency of 850 MHz. A better flavor of this phone for the U.S. would be type RM-722, supporting 850/1900/2100 MHz frequencies, but I was not able to find this type for sale anywhere.Searched again on the Internet and through Amazon, and found the Nokia 301.2. While it's a bit larger (2.4 in. display), and a tight fit in my old Krusell holster, the item's Amazon title shows support for both U.S. 3G frequencies (850/1900; type RM-841). Very similar features to the C2-01.5, with its simple but battle-tested Symbian-derived S40 operating system. And it's newer, with first ship in April 2013, so should theoretically have a longer service life. The phone works great indoors and outdoors in my area, but the RM-841 type will have no 3G support in Europe.So my final solution is to keep both phones. The 301.2 will be my standard U.S. phone, and the C2-01.5 will substitute on any occasional retiree trips to Europe or the Far East. Both phones have solid Nokia build quality, and are really best-of-breed for this type of simple ""candy bar"" phone. Both are unlocked, and worked immediately when I dropped my existing 3G-capable AT&T SIM into them. And both support quad-band GSM (850/900/1800/1900), so should work on these older 2G frequencies worldwide for as long as they continue to be supported.","26","helpful"
"Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 4 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)","Nokia","79","5","While most people clamor for Blackberries or iPhones or the latest Androids, I found myself eager to get back to the first brand that I ever used: Nokia. I won't lie - while I find the features of today's smart phones finally starting to live up to the hype, I am just unwilling to pay 100 dollars a month for all the service and contract craziness that comes with it. The average iPhone, for example, can cost over 3 thousand bucks over 2 years. I can't stand locked-down, over priced products that fail to really create compelling value for users that pay for the total package. Many companies, in their quest to make a buck off us, prohibit certain features or limit usability in ways that I always find frustrating. An example? 10 Dollars a month to use the Nuron's GPS feature through T-Mobile - when in fact you can and should be able to use it for free. My old Motorola wouldn't so much as let me copy 1 inferior quality, .3mp photo on my desktop without data charges, or picture texting charges. Stuff like that makes me want to just end the service and throw the phone in the can.Enter the Nokia 5800:With just a texting and voice plan, I am able to use 90% of the features of this phone. GPS works, and works great so far - the trick was to turn off assisted GPS and download maps straight to the device with the Nokia OVI suite. Then, using the built in GPS for all navigation needs was possible (including Turn-by-Turn Directions). The suite, by the way, also allows you to back up your device and sync it in different ways and edit contacts and things like that. This is usually an extra-cost item you have to pay for. And why should you? Losing your contacts alone would be a HUGE step backwards for most of us, and my opinion is that such protection should be standard across the board. Especially as our phones become more central organizers in our lives!Wi-Fi is a great substitute for paying for 3G services, but 3G will be there when and if you need / pay for it. You don't really need net services anyway if you aren't downloading any of the FREE apps, themes, games, etc. that the OVI store provides. You also don't necessarily need e-mail to be harassing you all the time while you are on the move. Heaven help you if you think you can web-browse and drive! Trust me, I used to have a blackberry for work which CONSTANTLY buzzed me with the days emails - the phone became a source of anxiety rather than a handy tool. With Wi-Fi, I can connect at the restaurant, store, or friends house I am hanging with, or at school, and have full access to extra content or web-browsing without worrying about X-Mobile's extra charges. It also provides me with a nice 'not now' feeling when I really do need to get away from work! One does have to constantly specify Wi-Fi instead of ""X-Zones"" in my case - but you can change connection priorities to help the ensure the phone doesn't jump on the information super-rip-off without your consent.Those two features alone make this phone really stand out to me, however there is more! The touch screen is responsive, and if you can't get it done with your stubby fingers, the included stylus does the trick. The screen is about big enough, and fonts can be enlarged for readability. I won't lie though, as with other phones, I wouldn't spend much time 'browsing' the internet - only things like checking email (easy with yahoo or google so far) or checking the weather, or seeking out an app make sense to me at the moment. Otherwise, I find that I probably wouldn't get much done at all without the stylus (just not enough screen real-estate to really handle today's typical sites). I do find that the auto-rotation of the screen gets worse when multiple apps are running (fails to rotate), but if one tips it right (think, parallel to the floor!), it works every time. I can type rapidly and accurately, and enjoy it more with the vibration off and just a small beep on. This was key for me, since I've used different touch screens and qwerty keyboards and often just can't do it with my blunt fingers. My only issue with the Nokia is that the full-screen qwerty touch does not put some common symbols on the primary screen, symbols like @ for emails or ) for smiley faces (hey I like to be friendly). They are an extra tap away. Otherwise, I have been impressed with the typical responsiveness and speed. Obviously, we all wish our phone were big as a laptop at times, or as small as a credit card at others. I think Nokia's compromise is good - the phone feels and looks small, is light, and doesn't feel any more burdensome than my old Motorola flip. Brightness is more than adequate except in direct bright sunlight, where it really washes out, and text is very clear. It really seems higher res to me than it is, and font sizing is changeable pretty much everywhere, and zoom is available if needed.The latest symbian update allows a seemingly infinite number of contacts on the home screen (previous was 4 - yuck), and did link to my primary emails without a hitch, and I can manually update to read them when I think I want to! I especially like that the contacts on the home screen are 'tracked' - I can see texts for example, that I've exchanged with just that one person, and send a new one. Graphics are cool (if not as polished as some of the newer phones) and the UI in general is pretty straightforward once you spend some time with it. I do find myself getting lost a lot however, or forgetting where certain settings are, though, this is not different to me than other phones I have used - some things are always front and center, other things get buried in sub menus. It would be nice if Nokia used some of the new nifty '3d' effects like pages turning or things moving when menus were changed, to help give a visual cue that you are 'interfacing' with the UI, but again eye candy versus capability? I would rather have control than better visuals when it comes down to it.""Express Music"" should mean that media is no-problem with this phone, and so far, I am impressed with the overall sound quality of the phone and the included headphones / mic, though the quality of those headphones, and the fit, is a little iffy to me (these are in-ear type, I think I prefer buds). Happy to know that they put emphasis on the sound rather than the look however. Plenty of volume by the way. The phone did an awesome job of organizing my files accurately, and provides a big in your face letter to let you know where you are as you search by album, artist, etc. They should have ported that feature to the contact list as it greatly simplifies the search! No major issues there. Also, the phone did come with 8gb of extra storage, enough for 600 or so high-bitrate Mp3s. Though, given the many uses of storage on this phone I think that I would need to upgraded to 16 gb or more to really stuff this thing with songs.Call quality has been excellent so far, both for the ear piece and for the speakerphone. The speaker phone sounds better than my laptop when playing music, more balanced and a a sense of actual bass. Signal strength has been excellent, and I'll be in the boondocks this weekend to find out how it cope there (usually service drops in and out). All in all voices sound full and clear, and I can detect problems with other people's phones (thats how good it has been so far).Camera? A dual-LED Carl Zeiss at 3.2 Megapixels. After a recent fire which burned down my building, I re-discovered the critical value of having even a bad camera on hand and available, if only by phone! Hence I am forgiving of camera phones in general. I've shot mostly indoors so far, and find that exposure ranges from unusable to good, grain is pretty bad in low lighting, but the flash is quite powerful. Focus lock is a tad slow at times, and I don't know why I get some blur even when using flash on occasion. I expect that like many cameras, broad daylight will reveal its best performance, and my good photos so far are really good. There are tons of available settings however, and all around I think this camera spanks the .3 mega pixel disaster I've had to rely on previously. But I won't be throwing away my digital camera any time soon.Battery life? This baby is rated for up to 8 hours of talk time, which is excellent. Yesterday I toasted the battery in about 6 hours from a mixture of trying out the Mp3 Player and playing with the internet, setting up, etc. I assume that when I stop constantly fiddling with this thing (oh how I love my new toy) It will go for days on normal use without a hitch. This is certainly one of those phones however, that multi-tasks, and one should remember to make sure that all un-needed apps are shut off b/t uses. The phone will not warn you, but you can check this from pretty much any menu. It recharges in about 2 hours I've found, which is really good. A charger is included, but the USB cable is data-only. Pick up a powered Micro-USB cable if you want to add a charging option to the phone. I'll be picking one up as it is generally more 'portable' than an AC adapter. I am going to GPS a 2.5 hour drive on today, and head to a low signal area. If the battery proves to be really strong, or weak in these conditions, I'll report back. Otherwise, assume that it did its job!Lets Do the pros and cons:Pros: Great Mp3 PlayerGreat GPSWi-Fi rules!Easy to transfer files8 gb memory included!Excellent Call qualityCan act as a USB wi-fi hotspot if you have a data plan (is it time to drop Comcast yet?)Well executed touch screen / stylus back-uplots of free and useful apps / wallpapers / you name it.OVI Suite makes life a little easier - backups, edits, map downloads, syncing, seamless so farEssentially UNDER priced given its capabilities (compare this phone to a 4-600 dollar newer phone)Feels like a true open-source, unlocked phone (unlike Google's ad machines and Apples prison-camp approach to technology)decent camera with functional macro lensCons:UI is not an A+ - more like a solid B.Learning curve - though not necessarily worse than other smartphones. But I have been trolling the net and thumbing the manual a lot so far.OVI not as well integrated as iTunes (but I hate iTunes anyway)Not sure what documents this thing can handle (pdfs will cost you)Your girlfriend will HATE the amount of time you invest getting set up, updated, downloaded, etc.I expected a plastic case to come with it - I got nothing. Europe only I guess. But it did come with a car mount for GPS, Headphones, Charger, and 8 gb of memory, so, I'll get over it.All in all, when I got the GPS working the way I wanted, I fell in love with this little phone - it is a true powerhouse for the price, and if it lasts, I expect it will be remembered as my first great smartphone. My biggest concern now is that Nokia has not been succeeding in the U.S. lately (though make no mistake, they are a world leader everywhere else, and innovative in their own right) and I fear that a switch to Meego and away from symbian will mean the general end of support for this kind of smart phone. This platform feels as though it could only get better, so that would be a sad loss. I feel like such a 'cheater' using this phone (buying direct from Nokia means NOT being FORCED to buy a data or GPS plan from my carrier) that I really wonder if the Nokia approach of providing an open and unlocked experience can really compete against the nickel and dime wireless economy being pushed by apple, at&t, google, verizon, and others. If I'm lucky, maybe I'll get a FREE update when Nokia decides what direction it wants to take.In the mean-time, I'll be greatly enjoying a solid all-around experience with a ton of value added for a minimal cost. This phone is the real deal, if you can live with the fact that it is not quite as polished (or large) as the more popular phones available at the moment. Though, capabilities and features have already improved through one update, perhaps another one will take it even further!Why are you hesitating? Take the plunge!","26","helpful"

"Nokia E75 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, Media Player, and 4 GB MicroSD Card(Silver Black)","Nokia","194","5","I have had the phone for over 24 hours so far. Great phone. Good sound, good voice, fast O.S. Good signal reception all around, though in N. NJ that is not really a problem.I charged it initially at home with the included AC charger, and at the office hooked it up with the included USB cable and saw the phone charging while I was playing with it and synching up my calendar.I swapped my SIM card from the old phone, (HTC Hermes/ATT 8525), to this one and it worked right away. ATT mediaNet needed no configuration even though I had only added data/texting to my account from online only minutes before. WiFi works well in my home. This is my first time using ATT MediaNet so I can't really comment, but it helped me compare prices on a microwave oven from inside a store. Amazon got an order for a microwave once I got home and I saved over $50. It is nice not hunting for a WiFi signal as I used to do. Glad I finally succumbed to paying for ATT's service. I am not comfortable with Nokias included browser yet, but it seems to work well. I may try Opera.I can work with office documents and synch up with my outlook calender faster than I could with my old HTC/ATT Win 6.1 smart phone. Nokia PC Suit is leagues ahead of MS Active Synch, and puts Motorola's software to the shame it deserves.Folks that play with it are amazed at how fast the phone responds when selecting applications. Instant response instead of a second or so wait as many Windows based phones have.The one issue I have had is I can not get the included headset to work properly as a headset. I suspect it is intended as just a music headset, but no matter what I do I can not get loud enough sound out of it, and the manual has no mention of it other than showing where to plug it in. When you attach the headset the phone asks what you want to use it as. Whether I select headset or headphones it does not seem to work well. The phone will warn you to use the phone mic. I recommend getting a better headset/headphones when you buy the phone, I am doing that right after I post this. Maybe with more use I can sort it out. I only tested it by calling my office voice mail, since I did not want to annoy friends and family by making them guinea pigs.This brings up the 3.5 mm jack the phone has. I am often on support calls. Sometimes for hours at a time. (Yes, I am an I.T. peon). I did not consider this when thinking about the phone, but there are NO standard headsets that use 3.5 jacks that I can find, they almost all use 2.5. The headsets that do use 3.5 are either iPhone style earbuds, which I find very uncomfortable, or ones intended for PC gaming, which use TWO plugs and are not usable on a phone. Not an over-the-ear one in the bunch. So I am stuck using bluetooth, which loses power fast and can't last long anough, or getting a clunky adapter so I can use a standard 2.5 mm headset, or trying an iphone earbud style headset that has the microphone in the wire, not on a boom, which has poor voice quality compared to a boom and hurts my ears after a few minutes. Slightly disappointing.I do like having the hidden qwerty keyboard, as I did with my prior phone, so that it is there when needed for documents, email, texting etc, but out of the way otherwise. Someday I may try a tablet-style phone, like the E71 or a blackberry, but this works well for me.One big reason I got this phone is the number pad for dialing. While touch screens are nice, having them as the only interface to the phone is a mistake.If you need to dial a number fast, such as 911, it can be very tough to do. Number pads are better, and if the primary use of the phone is as, well, a PHONE, it makes sense. It fits easily into my shirt pocket. I do not need to hang it on my belt and feel like Batman as I would with a tablet PDA.But touch screens are useful. I think this phone would benefit from one for navigating the menus, it would probably be faster than using the various keys. The screen could be larger, there would be room to extend it if Nokia moved the logo from the top of the phone.There is a lot left to play with on this, like the multiple profiles, etc. So there is still more to learn on this.But all-in-all, even with the headset issue, this is the best phone I have had yet, whether smart-phone or not. If this is an indication of where Nokia is going, they are going in the right direction.","26","helpful"

"NOKIA 301.2 FACTORY UNLOCKED QUADBAND 3G 850/1900 WORLD PHONE - WHITE","Nokia","269.1","5","I'm going to try to post the same review for two different Nokia ""feature"" phones, both of which I've bought through Amazon. First some context: I'm a geezer who likes dumb phones. I want a phone that will allow me to make and receive voice calls, and send and receive occasional text messages. That's it. No social networking, no automatic touch-and-pay capability, no spoken driving directions, etc. My previous phone, which I owned for about 8 years, was a Nokia 6030. Great phone!Recent phone calls and mailings from carrier AT&T warned me that my ""phone will no longer be supported"" after 11/30/14 in my service area in NorCal. I have a little technical background, but am not a phone geek. Had to do a bit of research on phone bandwidths, frequencies, and ""generations"". I wanted to understand why my old phone had finally reached end-of-life, and to pick a replacement that would provide similar capabilities and a long-as-possible future life. Hopefully this research will be helpful to others who face the same situation down the road.My old 6030 was a ""GSM-only"" phone. I had found on trips to Europe that it's also a U.S.-only phone. GSM is sometimes referred to as ""2G"", and it's this 2G function that AT&T is in the process of dismantling across the U.S., ending with final shutdown by 12/16. So I was looking for a 3G or better replacement phone.Both 2G and 3G generations of phones use different wireless frequencies in the U.S. (and Latin America) vs. the rest of the world (ROW). U.S. 3G runs 850 & 1900 MHz, with the lower ""more flexible"" frequency working better on insides of buildings. ROW 3G runs 900 & 2100 MHz.I initially chose the Nokia C2-01.5 for its small size (2-in. display), closest to my old 6030, and fitting nicely in my existing horizontal belt holster. However, early on I found the 3G reception indoors at home marginal, never actually dropping calls, but making normal conversations difficult, with audio gaps at both ends. Although the phone is represented as ""U.S. Version"", the phone's specific ""type"" is RM-721 (900/1900/2100), which omits the important U.S. inside-building frequency of 850 MHz. A better flavor of this phone for the U.S. would be type RM-722, supporting 850/1900/2100 MHz frequencies, but I was not able to find this type for sale anywhere.Searched again on the Internet and through Amazon, and found the Nokia 301.2. While it's a bit larger (2.4 in. display), and a tight fit in my old Krusell holster, the item's Amazon title shows support for both U.S. 3G frequencies (850/1900; type RM-841). Very similar features to the C2-01.5, with its simple but battle-tested Symbian-derived S40 operating system. And it's newer, with first ship in April 2013, so should theoretically have a longer service life. The phone works great indoors and outdoors in my area, but the RM-841 type will have no 3G support in Europe.So my final solution is to keep both phones. The 301.2 will be my standard U.S. phone, and the C2-01.5 will substitute on any occasional retiree trips to Europe or the Far East. Both phones have solid Nokia build quality, and are really best-of-breed for this type of simple ""candy bar"" phone. Both are unlocked, and worked immediately when I dropped my existing 3G-capable AT&T SIM into them. And both support quad-band GSM (850/900/1800/1900), so should work on these older 2G frequencies worldwide for as long as they continue to be supported.","27","helpful"

"Nokia E5-00 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy Email Setup, IM, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, Ovi Store with Apps, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (White)","Nokia","115","5","I was hesitatig about buying this product since there some reviews stating that this phone is below E72. Well, it is in absolute numbers since it does not come with secondary camera, which I've never used in E71 and E72, however, the SO is clearly more stable and runs faster, designed also to incorporate facebook and twiter among other social networks apps natively.Also, the assisted GPS computes your position faster than E72. I can say this because I did a simple benchmark between them. E5 took less than 10 secs, E72 more than 3 minutes.The keyboard, although similar in size and key distribution, is more comfortable, I guess it is due to an improved key shape and they are slighly wider, which is very noticeable when writing.The camera is 5MP, I guess is the same. I have to say that comparing only pixels in c├ímeras is like comparing food only with calories or cars with hp. There are more things to evaluate.The construction.... well, I don't know why people complain a lot about plastic construction since it's very similar to that of the E72, all plastic but the battery cover, made of stainless steel, which gives a nice feeling. Ok, it is not fron a casting as the E71 but that doesn't mean it has a weak built, it feels rock solid and less suceptible to be damaged since it weights less and then less energy is needed to be absorbed, thus less prone to be damaged.In general conclusion it's a great phone, with less features like the secondary camera, which I never use, but it costs less and IT HAS improvements learned from the very unstable E72.","27","helpful"

"Nokia N73 Unlocked SmartPhone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, MP3/Video Player, MiniSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver/Deep Plum)","Nokia","137","5","Just received it this week. Replacing my Nokia N90 with this model, the photos are much better (both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses, but this is 3.2 mp vs. 2.0 on the N90). Also, the N73 covers all radio bands, making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere (supposedly two internal antennae). The N90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by Cingular, so depending on the city I was in, I occasionally had very spotty coverage. The Symbian operating system in the N73 is faster than the older version on the N90, and best of all, it is much more compact than the N90, fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket. Last, there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back of the phone, protecting the camera lense (why aren't they all like this?). As usual, the flash isn't the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera, but otherwise I see this phone as the best of both worlds.","27","helpful"
"Lumia900 Factory Unlocked Smartphone with Windows Phone 7.5, 8 MP Camera, 4.3-inch Touch Screen, 16 GB Memory and Wi-Fi - No Warranty - Black","Nokia","288.88","5","This phone is absolutely fantastic for the price, but some potential buyers may not be fully aware of what to expect when it arrives.First off this phone is actually an unlocked AT&T Lumia 900, so there will be AT&T branding on the front. This means that the original packaging will already be opened, as the seller needs to manually unlock the phone before they ship it to you. This does NOT mean that it is a used phone. In order to be able to use non-AT&T sim cards, it is necessary for the seller to contact AT&T to receive an unlock code that frees it from the AT&T network. In my order, there was hardly any sign that it was handled at all, except for maybe a little finger print on the front glass. All the essential documents from AT&T and Nokia were inside the box, as well as a SIM ejector tool and a power cable.As is stated in the description, this phone will work on any HSPA/WCDMA 850/900/1900/2100 MHz/Quad-band data network and any GSM/GPRS/EDGE: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz cellular network, which in turn opens it for carriers in Europe and some in Asia. For US providers, there are currently only 2 major carriers that have GSM networks: AT&T and T-Mobile. There are other smaller carriers that offer services, but they utilize AT&T and T-Mobile towers in their coverage. These carriers include Straight Talk, Red Pocket Mobile, i Wireless, etc., and offer really affordable prepaid plans that I myself utilize. T-Mobile also offers a $30 a month prepaid plan that is rather reasonable.Unfortunately this phone will not work on any CDMA networks, which rules out Verizon, Sprint and US Cellular. For more information on the differences between CDMA and GSM networks, PCMAG.com has a fairly easy to read article explaining the differences between the two.Now onto the phone itself. I must say that I love this phone. It has a fairly decent Amoled 4.3 inch display, with a resolution of only 800x480. In our modern age of 1280├ù720 and above screens that may seem rather paltry. While using the phone normally it is looks as good as any other screen, but when watching YouTube videos it's lack of pixels becomes apparent. For me I use my iPad and laptop for watching videos so it doesn't matter to me all that much, but for others it may be a deal breaker.The build of the phone is absolutely fantastic. It is made of a solid polycarbonate body that is very resistant to scratches, with a screen made of Corning Gorilla Glass. Needless to say, it is very sturdy. The screen also seems to attract a large number of fingerprints as well, and for some reason is not all that easy to clean off. There is even a YouTube video where a hammer, saw and nail are taken to it and it comes up with little or no damage. The only thing on the phone that seems to be somewhat damageable is the metal piece around the camera lens. After less than 24 hours, there were already little scratches visible. For me I don't really care too much about it, but for others it may be really irritating.The camera itself is 8 megapixels with a Carl Zeiss lens, and it is just ok. There are certainly better phone cameras out there, with the iPhone 5 and Lumia 920 blowing it out of the water. For me it works best outdoors, as indoor shots tend to have more noise for whatever reason.This phone uses Windows Phone 7.5 Mango, so it is not the brand new Windows Phone 8. Sad thing about this phone is that it will never receive an update to Windows Phone 8. The hardware is just unable to fully handle the new OS. Instead it will receive Windows Phone 7.8, which gives it some Windows Phone 8 functionality, such as resizable tiles and the like. But apps in the future will cater just to Windows Phone 8, meaning that those with 7.8 and below will be left out in the cold with newer apps. Again, this isn't a deal breaker for me but for many it will be.One of the things that attracted me to this phone is Nokia Drive. Unlike most smartphone map applications, it does not require data in order to run. Before you set out on a trip you download fully detailed maps onto your phone, and then the built in GPS chip is used to map your location on the map. You can even download state or country specific maps, so you save space by not downloading the entire US map pack. All of this is done without data usage, which is great if you are traveling abroad. Oh, and it is completely free of charge. For travelers like myself, this is an awesome feature. I am also a student, so having a mobile version of Microsoft Office in my pocket is absolutely wonderful, for it allows me to edit documents while on the go.Overall this is a fantastic phone but definitely shows its age (close to one year). However, its awesome build quality as well as fantastic applications for travelers made it a must have for me. It fits my needs well, but potential buyers will need to consider whether it will work well for them.","28","helpful"

"Nokia C3-01 Unlocked Touch and Type GSM Phone--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)","Nokia","269.1","1","UPDATE! I had one of the first reviews for this phone, (maybe the first?) on Amazon and I can no longer recommend this phone for US customers. No US GSM carrier has sold this phone so Nokia has apparently decided it is not worth supporting in the US. They have some way of identifying the hardware and the new firmware is not available or downloadable through their software application. They have not only added features but according to release notes they have added bug fixes. Great, now I know I have a phone with software bugs that will never be fixed. My phone is also dropping calls indoors where I have never had problems with previous phones. I wonder if that is one of the bug fixes.I tried to open a ticket with Nokia customer support, this was my response from May 3rd.Thank you for contacting Nokia.You will be receiving a reply from one of our Customer Care Representatives at the earliest.Have a good day.It's June 9th, haven't heard a thing. Nice way to treat your customers.I had to replace the phone on my ATT plan ( Nokia Mural ) because the battery life was horrible, it dropped calls, would not receive calls and the menu navigation was awful.I am not interested in a smart phone. My top priorities are battery life, call quality and ease of use. I could also care less about a camera in a phone. I also carry my phone in my pocket so the size and shape of this phone is important. For the 2 weeks I have owned this phone it has met all of these criteria. I went 3 days before the first charge and that was after playing with all the phones features like WLAN, bluetooth camera and media player and I still had battery left. The call quality is superb, people talking to me on the other end have also noticed the difference, no dropped callls so far. The ring volume is EXCELLENT! The main screen and goto menus are totally customizable so if you don't find this phone easy to use it is your own fault. The resistive touch makes navigation easy. The screen is also very clear and the picture quality is excellent. Texting uses the traditional key pad and utilizes the touch feature for special charachters. This phone is thin and the back is rounded so it carries well in my pocket, sometimes I forget it is there.Now for the extra features. The camera takes pretty awful pictures but I find that true with most phones. Flash photography on this thing produces incredibly washed out colors. I the WLAN feature is great!, the default browser is very poor but it also comes with Opera Mini web browser pre-installed and that works surprisingly well. This does not surf the web as well as a ""smart"" phone but it is certainly tolerable. One of my favorite features is the * button can be held down for 3 seconds to turn on the camera flash for a flashlight. Love it! So far the software support from Nokia is poor because the phone is so new. There is no ActiveSync which I think is true for most phone. SUPL location, which uses tower triangulation to find your location, is available but I have not found an app that it works with yet. The java google maps does not support the touch screen. It comes with a built in mail app which support gmail. The is no plugin yet for Apple iSync. Hopefully there will be better software choices the longer this phone is out. The music player is relatively good, decent sound and a regular sized headphone jack is awesome. I also appreciate the ability to charge with both the Nokia barrel charger and micro usb.I own an ipod touch which senses electrical conductivity, this phone differs in that it uses resistive touch which senses pressure. It is not as sensitive but has the advantage of not exposing a glass surface ( possibly more durable ) and you could still use it with gloves on. Once you get use to using the touch on this phone it goes smooth. It seems to work best with your thumb.I would recommend this phone to anyone who likes to use their phone as a phone.","28","helpful"

"Nokia X3 Slider GSM Quad-Band Unlocked Cell Phone with 3.5 MP Camera and 2 GB SD Slot Memory -- U.S. Version with Warranty (Blue)","Nokia","269.1","2","Got this phone today. Right out of the box it appeared impressive, pleasing to eye and touch. Tried to get the back cover off according to the manual's instructions but it was no go. Finally I got my jeweler's screw driver out to try prying around the edges. Fortunately without damage, I've discovered what the manual omitted from their instructions. You have to pry up, gently, the lower back case with a blade or tiny screw driver before pushing down and sliding it out. The bottom part of the cover has two prong like tabs which will prevent you from sliding it until you pry it up first. Having survived this part of the struggle then I proceeded to install the simm card and battery. Looking at the manual again I tried to flip up the simm door and it just fell out. It appears the simm door was already damaged and was just pressed in there hoping to pass for the sale. So I never got past this part and requested a return RMA label from Amazon. The simm door and back cover definitely could use a more robust design. In my humble opinion, while this phone offers lots of pleasing features, Nokia dropped the ball.It's going to be returned via UPS tomorrow for full refund.","28","helpful"
"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (Black)","Nokia","59.95","5","This is my first smart phone. In the past, I've always opted for cheap and typically prepaid, but after finding I could not call an international cellphone with my cheap Tracfone, and a major disaster had occurred in the country I was flying to, I decided that having a phone that would not work in the country I was heading to, nor the ability to make cellular contact, if I chose, it was time to upgrade.I can now make international calls to cell phones and landlines. Because the phone was unlocked, it gave me the option to choose what phone I wanted in my price range and to choose between the GSM cell providers. The wireless works great. I can use the wireless feature to access my email and other web functions without having to get charged by a wounded bull (ATT) for traffic. The qwerty keyboard is better than many I have ever seen. The keys are a lot bigger, but the phone is still smaller than the latest HTC models.Some people have complained about the touch screen not being sensitive enough and that it's better to use a stylus. I find that it is just fine with my fingers. Yes, it doesn't seem completely solid when it's in a closed state (when the keyboard isn't in the slide-out mode), but it does feel solid when you are using the qwerty.Also, I love the fact that I don't have to use the qwerty keyboard to dial a number - the onscreen touch numerical keyboard works fine. There are some features that I haven't explored yet, but it has great sound when you're playing music and while it's loaded with some applications I didn't care for (Myspace, Friendster etc), you don't have to keep them.While it comes with a 2gig chip, I upgraded to an 8 gig and you can go up to 16gig, which is a nice option if you want to use it as an MP3 player.Update August 2011: Extremely happy with my purchase. Flew back to New Zealand and picked up a 2degrees SIM card at the duty free shop, before clearing customs.

"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (White)","Nokia","99.95","5","This is my first smart phone. In the past, I've always opted for cheap and typically prepaid, but after finding I could not call an international cellphone with my cheap Tracfone, and a major disaster had occurred in the country I was flying to, I decided that having a phone that would not work in the country I was heading to, nor the ability to make cellular contact, if I chose, it was time to upgrade.I can now make international calls to cell phones and landlines. Because the phone was unlocked, it gave me the option to choose what phone I wanted in my price range and to choose between the GSM cell providers. The wireless works great. I can use the wireless feature to access my email and other web functions without having to get charged by a wounded bull (ATT) for traffic. The qwerty keyboard is better than many I have ever seen. The keys are a lot bigger, but the phone is still smaller than the latest HTC models.Some people have complained about the touch screen not being sensitive enough and that it's better to use a stylus. I find that it is just fine with my fingers. Yes, it doesn't seem completely solid when it's in a closed state (when the keyboard isn't in the slide-out mode), but it does feel solid when you are using the qwerty.Also, I love the fact that I don't have to use the qwerty keyboard to dial a number - the onscreen touch numerical keyboard works fine. There are some features that I haven't explored yet, but it has great sound when you're playing music and while it's loaded with some applications I didn't care for (Myspace, Friendster etc), you don't have to keep them.While it comes with a 2gig chip, I upgraded to an 8 gig and you can go up to 16gig, which is a nice option if you want to use it as an MP3 player.Update August 2011: Extremely happy with my purchase. Flew back to New Zealand and picked up a 2degrees SIM card at the duty free shop, before clearing customs. By the time my luggage was checked for my next flight, I had a working phone and a New Zealand cell phone number - without the nasty international roaming charges.

"Nokia E63-2 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Ultramarine Blue)","Nokia","286","5","I wanted to ""upgrade"" from my old N95 (had it 2 or 3 years)and get a phone with full qwerty keyboard. Using Nokia's ""Switch"" utility, all my contacts were transfered to my new E63 within minutes... It was effortless... Thank you Nokia!TV SCREEN: The E63 screen is brighter, wider and better proportioned than the N95. Great for watching TV - yes, there's a $15 TV application that gives you CNN and about 100 other channels - Google ""Spb TV""SPEED: It's much faster and more streamlined than the N95 - maybe the E63 has a faster processor?FAST CAMERA: REALLY FAST! It boots up in about one second so it's much easier to point and shoot than the N95. 2.0 Megapixels isn't a problem - I prefer the lower resolution because it's much easier to email and share the pics on the net.PRIUS BLUETOOTH INTEGRATION: Bluetooth transfered ALL my 170 contacts to the Toyota's Address Book in one shot. The N95 couldn't do that!INTERNET MODEM: Works flawlessly... Nokia PC Suite allows me to connect my notebook to the internet anytime by just plugging the phone into its USB port and clicking a button. T-Mobile gives me unlimited access to the Internet for just $20/month.BATTERY: E63's battery is huge - about twice the size of the N95's - without making the phone more bulky - amazing. The E63 easily lasts far longer than the N95 without re-charging.VOLUME CONTROL: There's no physical volume control buttons on the E63. Instead, you use the central cursor control (during a call) and it works just fine. Honestly, who actually alters the volume of each call? I set the volume once and it normally stays at that level for all my calls - I don't miss having a separate volume control. Good job NOKIA!GMAIL: Nokia's combined email/message application works better than Google's own separate Gmail application. Setup was easy and Nokia integrates a Gmail inbox alert into the phone's main screen.BLUETOOTH TIP: Quickly turn on/off Bluetooth by pressing and holding the asterisk key * for a couple of seconds (from the main screen). Great for when you're in the car with passengers but don't want them listening to your ""hands free"" conversations.PRICE: You just can't beat it - there's NOTHING that comes close. You'll also need to order a Nokia USB cable (about $2 on Amazon) and why not treat yourself to an 8GB Micro SDHC card? (about $20).NOKIA E63 ROCKS!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!!!!!!!","29","helpful"

"Nokia 2730 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP Camera (Black)","Nokia","269.1","5","I just returned from a trip to Asia, visiting 2 countries. I did research to ensure this phone is supposed to have the bandwidth to support the wireless spectrums used by those 2 countries. Since the phone was already unlocked, I simply purchased a SIM local to the country, pop the SIM in, and activated the SIM/phone #. Wholla! Works like a charm. Called local to the country and back to USA. Sound quality is crystal clear. A friend could not even tell I was almost half way around the world when we chatted.The back case is a bit tough to open initially. The back cover will only slide downwards for a few millimeters, where then you can lift the cover to access the battery and the SIM slot. After the first couple of times, the stickiness wears off.You can then go to the Nokia website to download their Ovi Suite software, where you can transfer data between your phone and computer via USB cable.It would have been nice (would have been willing to pay a little more) for the vendor to have included the USB data/charger cable with the phone. I had to locate and purchase it separately on a different website.The one weakness of the phone is that there is no quick way to change volume without taking the phone away from the ear.","30","helpful"

It also has Wi-Fi, Blue Tooth and GPS.What I like about the phone:1/ It is very sleek and fits snugly in the hand2/ The voice quality and the speakers are excellent and have enough power3/ It has WiFi and Bluetooth4/ I am a stylus type of guy and I like the handwriting capability - probably the best feature5/ Changing the SIM or the SD is a snap.What I don't like1/ Making a phone call is pathetic - how many clicks do I have to make in order to make a simple phone call. And why does it have to ask me if I want to make a video call ?!? Like I do video calls from my land line.2/ So far I haven't found a way to do phone card call, without having to type in about 20 digits.3/ Could not manage to get the blue tooth conduit to run with my Vista Laptop. Vista asks for a driver, Nokia says that they have provided the driver.4/ Even the full size QWERTY is very difficult to use. You need to press much harder on the LCD so fat fingering is very common.5/ Help and support are pathetic6/ The battery died after about 8 hours, during which time I had made 3-4 calls. It virtually died it went from full charge to almost empty in a matter of 10 minutes.All in all, I am considering to return it and get a phone that actually works, without having to have manicure or three hands.============================================ 10 DAYS LATER UPDATE:-------------------------------Here we go:PROS:1/ The battery issue disappeared after about 1 week nightly recharging. Now the battery indicator has a tendency to be 100% all day long, and I do talk more than when I was testing the phone. I am not sure if the indicator is correct, but at least it has not let me down while I am talking.2/ The phone has relatively decent ""Voice Command"" feature. That resolved my issue with the number of clicks to make a simple phone call.3/ I received an SMS from NOKIA - telling me how to turn my GPS feature on. That was awfully nice of them - ~2 hours after the activation the GPS found me. Obviously there is a ""soak"" period. So don't expect immediate results. The ""soak"" period also falls in the CONS category.4/ I must admit that the ""Camera"" is fairly decent. Having said that - I did not buy the phone because of the camera. If you need a camera - ""you buy a camera"". I am looking more into the ""organizer"" functionality. (""I-DON'T-have-to-attach-my laptop-to-my-butt-but-it-helps-if-handy) kinda' application.CONS:1/ The voice command works fairly well. The problem is that NOKIA has prerecorded commands from, I am sure, some terrific Finnish guy, who has a terrible Finnish accent (as far as English is concerned). That is easy to overcome, as far as Applications are concerned (you can override him with your voice), but I am yet to figure out how to change the preconceived notions, as far as ""Contacts"" are concerned - I cannot figure how to create a voice command to call my wife, unless I mimic the Finish guy's ideas as to how to pronounce a name.2/ The DTMF issue is a real problem. I do a lot of call card calls and conference calls. The phone has ""Copy --> Paste"" function, but this does not cut it. There MUST be a way to pre-program your call-in numbers, and log-in with 1-2 'clicks'.I do understand that ""One"" is not supposed to talk on the phone while driving, but this is ""One's"" decisions. By no means it is NOKIA's decision.3/ In order to access features there is a substantial time lapse between the moment the feature is activated ( you click) and the moment you can use the feature. I wonder why is that!?!WHO IS WATCHING?!? AND WHAT that ""WHO"" IS?The long ""soak"" frustrated me and invoked questions about the safe keeping of my privacyCONCLUSIONThis phone is an acquired taste ... or maybe Symbian is an acquired taste ... I don't know.It has potential, if NOKIA fixes the annoyances in the firmware - e.g. the voice command works fine, minus the Finnish accent. GPS works,AND people know how to make it work and what to expect. (SMS simply does not cut it).There is no way to convince me that this phone is user friendly. It simply is not. You can easily access the most basic features, but if you want to do something beyond basics - it is a nightmare.I am sorry, but I do not buy a ""cheap"" $340 phone, just to figure out how to make a phone call, or take a note, or make an appointment, or take a picture. I buy it to be able to do all of the above - EASY.And learning how to do that has to take place in ""reasonable"" time - say 1-2 hours. This is not the case. So far I have invested about 8 hours to figure out the some of the questions, that are most annoying. Probably it will take twice as much to figure the answers.How about an brand new idea! How about, a user guide that actually guides you?!? Or how about some useful webcasts, that would teach you how to use the phone features, without having to spend 7 days trying to figure them out !?! What a challenge !!!THE VERDICTI WILL KEEP the phone.I will keep it, simply because, based on my experience and judging by reviews about the competition, it is MORE acceptable.It is nowhere near to the iPhone, but that is another can of worms.I expect huge improvements from NOKIA on:1/ User interface2/ User manuals or instructions3/ Ease of use - functionality.All of the above can be fixed by software, so I am expecting the upgrades.Happy upgrading !!Enough said - 2-1/2 stars - FINAL !============++++++++++++++++++============LAST UPDATEThe headphones coming with the phone are AMAZING !!!Easily comparable to BOSE.I heard depth and breadth of music, that I hadn't experienced in a long time.

I don't like the fact that this is an unlocked AT&T phone, that should be noted on the product page (not that it's 'factory unlocked').The flow of the OS is quite simple and easy to use, everything is in alphabetical order in the apps list, and the Start screen lets you put whatever apps you want on it and in any order. One weird thing about the 820 (WP8?) is the back arrow vs the Windows button. If you use the Windows button then press the back button it will return to the program you closed (doesn't happen on Android). There are many very useful apps for this OS. Offline maps and translators are quite useful when you're traveling, especially when they're free.The phone itself is nicely designed, simple and clean, and the build quality seems good. The battery cover is a bit difficult to remove (make sure you have everything you want/need to put in when you do this, so it's only required once). The camera is very good and the pictures are clear. For the individual who sat on his phone, it's not shocking at all that it broke, and quite uncertain whether Gorilla Glass would have made a difference.","31","helpful"

"Nokia 6350 Unlocked GSM Flip Phone with Second External TFT Display, 2MP Camera, Video, Internet Browser, GPS, Bluetooth, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - Red","Nokia","269.1","4","Had another brand with a touch screen that didn't work well. If you touched the phone, not even the screen, it would disconnect the incoming call. Couldn't carry it in my pocket. Slightest movement would make the phone do who knows what even with the touchscreen locked. Gave up on touchscreens after the manufacturer of that phone replace the original and still had the same problem. Had to discontinue my unlimited data plan because the carrier (AT&T) didn't care about the problem with the new phone. I had it over 30 days and that was enough for them . This is an unlocked world phone. That means I can use it with any carrier anywhere in the world. When my contract with AT&T (yes, they gave me the other phone for a penny when I signed a two year contract, phone doesn't provide what I paid for but the contract is still in effect), I can use this same phone when I switch carriers. The only thing I don't like on this phone is the inability to delete unused icons from the menu screen, or to put icon shortcuts on the screen that you do use. Have to open an icon (My Stuff) then scroll to a menu item (Tools) then scroll to Recent Calls to see who called you when you were unavailable. Would be nice to have that menu item as an icon on the main screen. RECEPTION IS GREAT. Have to emphasize that feature. I'm in a rural 3G area (4G coming soon, or so they say) and the other phone from AT&T had two, one or no bars of service. This phone has either four or five all the time. Never dropped a call like it did all the time with the Pantech Renue from AT&T.","35","helpful"
"Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone","Nokia","59.95","1","I'm on a contract with T-Mobile, and I wanted to get a new phone while still on the contract, so I initially got the Nokia C1-01, which I bought from Amazon as well, however I didn't have access to picture messaging nor internet. I thought that for $120 on Amazon, that the Nokia C3-00 was a steal that combined a good amount of features like wi-fi and EDGE network access and custom shortcuts balanced with a reasonable and frugal price, so I got it.When the phone arrived, it was as simple as just swapping the SIM cards (as it usually is with any GSM phone, and some newer CDMA phones) from my old phone with the Nokia C3-00; I still wasn't able to use picture messaging, but I was sold on the Wi-Fi, the EDGE network support and the Mail and Contacts custom shortcuts.I started doing some occasional internet browsing with the phone; while not all websites are available or nicely viewed on the phone, Google Mobile adapted most of the webpages to be viewed with the phone. While on Wi-Fi I was able to attain speeds of 1500 kbps (kilobits). The phone was UNLOCKED !!!! I was finally going to be able to run Gmail and Google Maps without having to get a Blackberry or an iPhone, and it did so beautifully (read the instructions on how to use Google maps, otherwise you'll be a little frustrated when trying to pan in/out and zoom in/out the map).One good day TMOBILE sent me an update, and the phone did ask me if I wanted to apply the update, but I must have pressed the wrong key and it applied the update which rendered my phone unable to do all the nice things that it was able to do before: I was left with a boring gray background, only the Nokia ringtone left to choose, the custom shortcut keys no longer worked (couldn't even choose something else for them to do), and clicking on the browser did nothing.To cut a long story short, I called Tmobile asking them why they were sending updates to my phone...they were not aware. They told me that they couldn't provide me with much support since I had bought the phone from somebody else...that's perfectly understandable.I was however expecting good customer support from Nokia and they failed to deliver: I called a total of 5 times that solved nothing, and in between those calls, Nokia would advice every time to contact T-Mobile to provide me with values to access the web..I just couldn't get them to understand that it was the applications that failed to respond. I was asking to return the phone to its factory OS condition. They got me to update the phone from OS version 4 to 8, but did nothing either.I am looking now at going to some sort of Android OS phone....Symbian is just dead and you can't get as much info.The phone itself is a nice one, but since I assume that you'll be buying it to run on either AT&T or T-Mobile, I just wanted to warn you about what could happen to you, and complain about the poor Nokia support","35","helpful"

"Nokia Lumia 822 GSM Unlocked GSM Windows Phone - White","Nokia","88.99","5","Bought my second Nokia Lumia 822. This one I bought from Mango instead of Verizon as Verizon no longer carries it. My first one I bought in 2012 at the Verizon dealers advice, and I loved the phone. I dropped it in a river two years later and had to replace it. Verizon stopped carrying the phone and told me it was obsolete, and talked me into an I-phone 5s or 5c. I ended up having that phone for 1 and 1/2 months, and I loved it, (except for the texting, windows phones are much better for texting) before I dropped it at the train station and destroyed it. The 2014 I-Phone did absolutely nothing that my 2012 Lumia 822 didn't do. It was really a joke to spend more for the I-Phone when the Nokia Lumia 822 did everything the I-Phone 5 did. The only thing I liked better about the I-Phone was that it came standard with bus routes for their mapping apps. I loved that, exact times of bus routes and trains around the country and select the fastest route. It really didn't get any easier. But I found an app for the windows phone that did the same thing. HERE MAPS app does the same thing and it is free. Or you could just use google maps. All in all, Apples' new I phone 5 does nothing the Nokia Lumia 822 doesn't do. I bought mine from Mango Vendor for $100 new two days ago. Works great. Thankyou Mango.","35","helpful"

"Nokia N9 Unlocked GSM Phone with 64 GB Internal Memory--International Version (Black)","Nokia","228.88","4","Let's just get this out of the way right now. The Nokia N9 is the most beautiful phone hardware I've ever owned. Not a surprise, as only Nokia and Apple churn out engineering this elegant. I'm somewhat of a phone junky, as I've owned most of the headliner phones from the major OS's: iPhone 4s, galaxy s2, galaxy nexus, Samsung focus, etc.Hardware: I'm typing this on my iPad, so don't have the typing patience to get too much into this, but wow this hardware is elegant. The curved screen complements the swipe os perfectly, the unibody construction is so well out together, the large generous speaker on the bottom provides plenty of volume, and the clear black screen really does provide such a vivid picture that icons look like they're floating on the screen. But really, you have to hold this phone to appreciate it. The old king of design (iPhone 4s) has been supplemented.One more thing on hardware, and this was huge for me. The antennae on this phone is pure Nokia, I.e. excellent. Typically, I have difficulty getting signal in many places in San Francisco with AT&T, but the N9 keeps a signal everywhere I go. In the east bay in the hills where my iPhone and nexus routinely would lose signal the N9 has 2-4 bars. It's really amazing.Software: the Meego experience is simple and effective, and I love it. Before Meego, my favorite OS was WP7. To be clear, when I rate an os, personally I'm excluding available software (ie apps). The reason is I'm thinking of the engineering and the thought out into the OS design, not how many developers chose to support it. I'm not saying apps are not important, far from it, but the number of available apps is so individually relevant (or not so) to the Individual user you have to decide how important that is to you.Much like wp7, Meego provides most used functionality with the minimal amount of screen interaction. Close an app, slide down. Switch an app, swipe right. Get notifications, swipe left. Minimize an app, swipe up. That's it. Simple, effective, and gorgeous.The N9 also comes with an incredible amount of connectivity out of the box. Gmail, exchange, Picasa, Dropbox, skype, twitter, Facebook, and more. I especially love how Skype is built in. Make calls and message directly from within the app.Battery: my only gripe with the phone. With everything enabled (especially gtalk, Skype, and Facebook chat) the battery is done after 12 hours of light usage. Start using the phone and youre down to 8 hours...that's is horrible. When you're NOT logged in to the messaging apps, battery shoots up to 2-3 days of light usage, and 16 hours of heavy, which is brilliant. Im not sure if this imitedto a few vocal N9 users, or if this all phones, but this is my experience.Summary: if you don't need a lot of external software, but need a heavily reliable phone that does mail, messaging, camera, Skype, music and video brilliantly, it is amazing. If you need more, definitely take a look at the lumia 900. It's not out yet, but supposedly has the same hardware design with a great os as well.","41","helpful"

Here are what I think are the pros and cons so far:PROS:Nice size touchscreen, very bright and vibrant.Disregard what the previous reviewer said about the blue stripe on the bottom of the phone because THERE IS NONE. The plastic cover on the screen has a blue stripe but the actual phone is COMPLETELY WHITE.Camera quality is great and shutter speed is super quick.Keyboard is easy to use and keys are big.Interface is simple and easy to understand.CONS:A little bulky.Camera could get scratched easily since there is nothing to cover it.Definitely will need a screen protector.One other thing that I found to be more of a nuisance than anything else is that the GPS positioning option was turned on by default so every couple of minutes it would activate itself and eat up a few cents of the money on my phone. Luckily it was easy to turn off so nothing to worry about anymore.Overall I really like this phone. I've only had it for a short time but so far I haven't had any problems with it. I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a touchscreen phone with full keyboard that is also budget-friendly.","42","helpful"

"Nokia 2720 S40 Unlocked Flip Phone with 1.3 MP Camera with Bluetooth--US Version with Full Warranty","Nokia","264.1","4","I got this phone as a replacement phone for my father. He had been using a Motorola V195, but it suddenly stopped working after many years of faithful service. I was looking for a simple, easy to use phone similar to the V195, because he's not tech savvy, and for him, the simpler, the better. The Nokia 2720 S40 Flip fit the bill. An added bonus is that the call quality is much clearer on the 2720. It's a straightforward flip phone, with some nice features. In fact, after setting up his phone, I liked it so much, I bought one for myself, to replace a Samsung flip phone. But the 2720 I bought for myself came from WalMart, for $31/shipped site-to-store. The phones are similar, but not identical. I'll do my best to explain the differences below:To begin with, the Amazon 2720, even though it says ""US Version with Full Warranty"", does NOT come with a full US warranty from Nokia. The good folks at UnlockedCellPhoneKings, who filled the Amazon order, explained to me that ALL UNLOCKED CELL PHONES void the manufacturer's warranty! They also stated that Amazon writes the headings for the ad and they have no control over what Amazon writes. In terms of the warranty that does come with the Amazon 2720 -- THEY (UnlockedCellPhoneKings) provide their OWN warranty (in this case, a 1 year warranty). And while that's better than nothing, it is not the true full US warranty that comes with the WalMart pre-paid Nokia 2720. Furthermore, the WalMart prepaid 2720 comes in a sealed package, with the actual manual that's specific to the 2720. The 2720 that I got from UCPK's came was in a generic box with a generic manual. I called UCPK's to ask why, and they explained that they buy in bulk, then put together packages after they get an order. They claimed that the phones are brand new, but there's really no way of knowing that. I would suggest that if you buy one of these phones from Amazon, rather than from WalMart, you buy it from UnlockedCellPhoneKings -- they were a pleasure to deal with, and they have a toll free number.As far as the phone itself, I prefer the one from Amazon. It has certain options (i.e. it allows you to re-configure BOTH soft key pads, rather than just the left soft key pad), and the home page (the page you see when you first open the phone) has the time in a much bigger font than the WalMart 2720. But that's basically aesthetics, and each person's preferences are going to be different. In terms of actually using the phone, they're both easy to set up and easy to use. (I had read that some people felt the volume was too low when using the speakerphone. I think the reason is that the speakerphone does not use the same volume setting as the normal mode. You have to press the up volume button while you're on the speakerphone in order to increase the volume to a more audible level.) The only real drawback I found is that these phones are fingerprint magnets. I would suggest getting some inexpensive face plate covers (front and back), since they faceplates not only provide protection to the phone, but also they cut down considerably on the fingerprints.In terms of a simple, easy to use flip phone, the 2720 does a good job, and these types of basic phones are becoming harder and harder to find. And while I like some of the features of the Amazon 2720 better than the WalMart 2720, for the price, I'd go with the WalMart 2720 for $31/shipped to the store. The one inconvenience, as another reviewer pointed out, is the fact that there's no USB outlet or removable memory card on the 2720, so even though it takes photos, there's no simple, direct way to GET the photos from the phone to your computer. There are two possible options. 1 is to get a USB Bluetooth dongle to plug into your computer. You then pair the phone with the computer (but not as a modem) and you can transfer files from the phone to the computer, or vise versa, IF you have the right software. (Nokia has 2 free software suites -- Nokia PC Suite (which is older), and Nokia OVI Suite. Even though PC Suite is older, a lot of users seem to prefer it to the newer OVI Suite. Both are available for free download on the Nokia site.)Another option is to get a USB SIM card reader. They work like memory card readers, and range in price from around $8 to $30. I read some reviews and the cheaper ones don't seem to work all that well. The one that seemed to get the highest reviews was the: Dekart SIM Card Reader + SIM Manager 2 software. Here's the Amazon link: http://www.amazon.com/Dekart-Card-Reader-Manager-software/dp/B0045BIUGG/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1296592924&sr=8-5. It can also be purchased directly from the Dekart site: [...](Personally, I find the shipping costs to be ridiculous from both places, but I was unable to find this item from any other source other than Amazon or Dekart directly.)(NOTE: I have T-Mobile, and the SIM cards from the old phones worked perfectly in both the Amazon 2720 and the WalMart 2720. I simply inserted the old SIM cards, synced them with the built-in phone address book memory, and was on my way. The folks at UCPK's explained that the 2720's that they sell are designed to work fully with T-Mobile. They will still work with AT&T, but not all of the options will be fully operational. The ones from Walmart appear to be locked into T-Mobile, but I'm not 100% sure about that.)","44","helpful"

"Nokia X3 Slider GSM Quad-Band Unlocked Cell Phone with 3.5 MP Camera and 2 GB SD Slot Memory -- U.S. Version with Warranty (Blue)","Nokia","269.1","4","For those who don't want to renew your contract, this is a wonderful unlocked GSM phone with quite a lot of feature at a very reasonable price.Before I get started, there is one point to keep in mind. This is an unlocked phone. There is some configuring that has to be done in order to get internet and MMS working with your provider. Nokia used to have a site that would send carrier specific info to the phone, but I believe they have taken it down. You may have to search forums and/or call your carrier customer support for this one. Call and SMS will work ""out of box"", but anything internet dependent will require some fiddling.On to the review.I have found for a $140 phone, this pretty much does everything I'd want a basic cell phone to do, almost to the point where I don't really care about have a higher end smart phone.Call quality is great and I have found that the Series 40 UI far easier to use than most of the carrier locked phones we have in the UI. If you're using an ATT or TMO Nokia phone, you are not experiencing the full potential that Nokia has to offer.Nokia's email client is great for basic email checking and even without 3G data capabilities, I found EDGE data speeds more than sufficient. With T9 predictive entry, even sending basic reply messages is relatively quick.The media player keys are a handy touch, and the FM radio is also a nice additional feature. Overall, I found Nokia's generic media player much more pleasant than that of most other low end phones.Onto some cons...I have accidentally hung up on some calls as the screen tends to stick to my face and if I keep moving my hand, I will eventually slide the phone far enough to cause the call to end.There is no feature to auto-lock the keys when the slider is closed. You either have to select the ""Lock"" option immediately after closing the slide or enable the auto keyguard feature to lock after a set amount of time. This is kind of a vestige of Nokia's candy bar only phone days.No Nokia Maps. Even though this phone has no GPS, it's nice to still look up maps when you're in a bind. I've used several other S40 phones with this feature(with and without GPS) and although it's no Google Maps or Nokia Navigation, for such an inexpensive phone, it's good enough.Overall, for the price, you will get a lot. If you're looking for a basic unlocked phone sans contract, this is the phone for you. You may even be pleasantly surprised.","46","helpful"

"Nokia E63-2 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Ultramarine Blue)","Nokia","286","4","I've had the E63-2 (North American Version) for a few days now, and am really loving this phone so far. It's my first Symbian (S60) phone, so I was a little hesitant about the learning curve. And to be honest -- it's not anywhere near as intuitive as the iPhone or Android. But if you're a little bit tech savvy, it won't be a problem at all.The phone feels great in hand. I've held the E63's big brother, the E71, and I prefer this one better. The rubberized plastic doesn't feel cheap at all, offers a superior grip, and maybe best of all, doesn't get all smudged up with fingerprints. It's still relatively slim, though not as sleek as the E71. But again, I prefer it -- it's just easier to hold.The QWERTY is nicely designed, and the keys feel great to push. Numerically, the ""0"" is to the right of the ""9"" instead of underneath the ""8,"" which is kind of jarring at first, but I got used to it. Another design annoyance is the lack of a volume rocker on the side... you have to use the D-Pad, which means taking the phone away from your ear mid-conversation. No dedicated camera button either, but that didn't bother me much at all -- you can take a picture in two button clicks away from the home screen.Voice quality is crystal-clear, rivaling any land-line I've ever used. The ringer's nice and loud, though getting to the Sound settings themselves require a series of button pushes, instead of being ""right there.""The default mail client is decent, though I've run into some problems connecting to my ISP's POP3 mail server. I downloaded Nokia's new mail client, which is a lot more graceful.There are lots of apps available on the internet for this operating system, but they're scattered all over the place and they're hard to find unless you really know what you're looking for. However, that's going to change very soon, as Nokia's ""Ovi Store"" is set to open next month (May 2009). Looks very promising -- and even appears to have the elusive S60 Facebook app that's been conspicuous in its absence.Anyway, great UNLOCKED smartphone for the price. Might be lacking in some minor areas (no GPS, average camera quality, no volume rocker), but it makes up for it in others (WiFi, stable operating system, app store coming soon).Strong recommendation from me.","48","helpful"
"Nokia Lumia 1020 32GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 41MP Camera 4.5"" - White - International Version, No Warranty","Nokia","296","5","I am a serious photographer and so having a camera around me at all times is a great thing. That is the sole weakness of my full frame DSLR system and the Nokia 1020 (Microsoft 1020 now?) fits the bill. For review of the camera look elsewhere - there are many and all are positive.Actually, I did not purchase the phone from Amazon. Why? I placed the order with one of the companies associated with Amazon. They took the money and disappeared. When the phone did not arrive at the time it was supposed to, I had to fill a relatively simple online form with Amazon. I was not the only one duped, so Amazon knew about this company and the association was cancelled. I called Amazon shortly after filling the form. I talked to a very pleasant lady that appreciated the discomfort and frustration I felt, promptly processed my request for reimbursement and I received the money promptly. Great service Amazon!!!! although I hope you will not have to go through this.I purchased Nokia 1020 from another online vendor. For me the surprise is the Windows 8 environment. This is my first smartphone, so I do not have in mind anything to compare it to. It does not seem too difficult to learn to use it. Everybody talks about a dearth of apps. Perhaps this is an issue if you want a specific app that is not available on Windows or if you are an app collector. If you just want a couple of apps to do a few basic things (GPS, VOIP, Battery utility etc.), you have great many apps to choose from (free and for pay), and some of them seem good.Aesthetically, the phone is sleek, it fits comfortably in my hand and feels substantial. It meets my expectations based on my reading before the purchase and I am pleased.","48","helpful"

"Nokia N9 Unlocked GSM Phone with 64 GB Internal Memory--International Version (Black)","Nokia","228.88","5","Great stuff:- top-notch design -- N9 looks amazingly good (to me it looks better than newer iPhones)- excellent manufacturing quality- excellent phone component (better than iPhone with AT&T; I'm getting a very good reception in places where iPhone repeatedly failed with AT&T network)- works with both AT&T and T Mobile- superior swipe technology (also better than on Nokia Win platform too)- integrated social networks- 64 GB- much more ROM for processing apps (I was running out of ROM on N8 with maybe a dozen or so themes and maybe a dozen of downloaded apps)- excellently implemented *Dashboard* concept that shows important stuff (appointments, missed phone calls, new emails, etc)Good stuff:- solid camera (but N8 was better in that respect and so is newer iPhone)- easy setup- easy email setup if you have a GMAIL account(s) (for private Hotmail use N9's Exchange server setup and it works great since MS put the Active sync))- WiFi has a solid range- new Linux-based MeeGo OS is pretty good ... even excellent (but I think most people will find iOS and Android either easier or more intuitive)- over-the-air or cloud sync works very well (and better be since Nokia is shutting down some services and N9 is incompatible with Nokia Suite)- battery life seems to be OK (about same as an average iPhone with a few power saving enabled and the BT off)Bad stuff:- if you are addicted to collecting various apps, N9 is either not for you or it could be a cure for your addiction. While most of the things that a typical user will ever want to use are covered through Nokia Store apps (most of them are free), the Spartan system rules N9 compared to iOS and Android.- no memory expansion slot (think about 64GB instead of 16GB version when ordering)- no user-replaceable battery (same as iPhone)- incompatible with Nokia Suite (use Nokia Link that I found only marginally or minimally useful since it doesn't sync contacts or calendars)- Nokia killing some nice *convenience* services that makes you wonder if their commitment to Windows Mobile platform is going to leave behind some long-time Nokia fansOverall a great product from Nokia, even superb if your main thing is to use this device mainly for phone calls, check email, do some light social networking. If you are more into entertainment on your phone then stick with iPhone or an Android-based phone. If you plan to switch phones, make sure your current phone is using the microSIM card or you'll need to get one from your cell provider or use the cutter. If you are switching from a 4G or newer AT&T iPhone than you already have microSIM.","49","helpful"

"Nokia - 106.3 Negro/black Unlocked Dualband GSM 850/1900","Nokia","269.1","5","This phone is incompatible with MMS messaging, which your friends with smartphones may use from time to time. It only uses the standard SMS technology, so I received many texts which the phone told me could not be displayed, and it took me a few weeks to figure out that I had missed some crucial messages. Not the phone's fault, of course; I just didn't do my research well enough.If you are mainly going to be making phone calls, this phone is GREAT. It's light and small, buttons feel good, battery life is long, and the phone is solid as a rock like Nokia always is. I love Nokia, and this one feels like a warhorse, just like the Nokia 6030 that I bought eight years ago that this 106 replaced. If texting is critical for you like it is for me, then this is not the phone for you. I just ordered the Nokia 111 to replace this one- it can handle SMS and MMS messages.","53","helpful"
"Nokia Lumia 635 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8.1 Quad-Core Phone - Black","Nokia","75.99","4","I don't know whether this phone is truly unlocked because I didn't have another provider's sim to try. I'm on an ATT network anyway so my sim was good to go. I like the Windows platform... better than Android, it seems more stable and more organized. This is an entry level phone but it does all I need a device to do at this point in my life. I gave up a lot of flashy hardware extras, and some software extras by making this move backwards. My only regret is the lack of apps that allow more control over personalizing the phone's use. This model doesn't support an automatic power on/off ... or a gravity or proximity sensor sleep/wake for the screen. It doesn't support the double tap screen ""wake up"" either. I will be using the power button a lot more than I had to with the newer Androids, and I wish Windows or Nokia would update the hardware controls to offer those features. Otherwise, the 635 is sturdy, lightweight, the right size, and I don't miss not having an led flash because the camera takes decent pix without one. I find Cortana a little dense at times, but we're getting along okay. I wish Nokia would put a voice microphone on the keyboard, independent of Cortana, for those of us who like to dictate text rather than type. Bottom line, it's a real nice phone, but not a great one.

"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (Black)","Nokia","59.95","3","04/05/2012 UPDATE: I want to do a quick comparison between the Nokia C6-00 and Android phones, specifically Samsung Nexus S by Google. I've been using the Google android phone for the past 11 months and it did EVERYTHING I needed it to do from paying for Starbucks coffee using a Starbucks app so I didn't need to carry my Starbucks card around and accessing multiple MS Exchange accounts to the interface and OS being slick and nimble as well as Google directions/mapping/GPS; the MAJOR downside to smartphones such as Android and others is the fact that they are battery drainers because of the intense use of power for the OS and display especially. I could not last more than 6-8 hours on Android and this is with setting the Display to the lowest brightness at all times which is a pain when outdoors in bright sunlight. That was the ONLY issue with my Android. Anyway, it did everything I needed so I stuck with it. Until recently the sounds stopped working. So I sold it and now I am back with Nokia. The strength of Nokia is the battery lasts a good 14-15 hours on standby (not sure why this Amazon description states 16 days or so, no, 15 hours, so at the end of the day before going to bed, you need to charge it up again for the next day). I can only add ONE MS Exchange email account on Nokia and I also have Gmail installed. The OS is not as slick and fast as Android and there is a ""white screen"" lag, but you put up with it. The sounds, ringing, call quality and reliability of the Nokia as a PHONE first and foremost is second to none. The Android (Samsung) had low ringing volume even at maximum. Also Sprint service for the Android was weak in my area, so ATT under Nokia was better. The Nokia is a ""workhorse"" of a phone that is loud (volume, I like!) and does a barely ok job at being a 'smart phone.' I will keep using it for now because of long battery life and I can switch out the SIM card to my flip phone using the same data plan for traveling using a small flip phone, esp. overseas like Europe (ATT only charges $10 month for unlimited data since it is not considered a smart phone versus minimum $30 for smart phone). Will I eventually switch to a smart phone when something I like comes out, YES, of course, the Android experience (except for battery life) did EVERYTHING I needed a smartphone to do (rich apps for banking, Starbucks, etc) and my LIFESTYLE. What will I look for in a smart phone next time? STRONG BATTERY LIFE (EASILY LASTING 15 HOURS ON STANDBY OR BASICALLY WHAT I CALL A 'WHOLE DAY' BEFORE CHARGING AT NIGHT), LOUD RINGER AND VOLUME, 4G CAPABILITY, HANDLE MULTIPLE MS EXCHANGE EMAIL ACCOUNTS.06/20/2011 UPDATE: Bought this phone in September 2010. There is still a slight lag (in the form of a ""white screen"") in between applications but other than this and the slight heft (weight) to the phone, it is a good sized pull out keyboard phone. For a while the Ovi maps and Ovi store apps did not work, I finally figured out I needed to delete the old files from apps manager and redownload Ovi maps and Ovi store. The trick is it is a Catch 22, you cannot download Ovi maps with Ovi store (the PC sync did not work for me in the first place), and you cannot if Ovi store did not work, I finally went to the browser and searched download ovi store and did it that way and once I go Ovi store working, downloaded Ovi maps and then everything works now. The music was a trick, you need to sync to your PC and copy and paste to the C6 after created a ""Music"" folder, then in the C6 press music and then library and then ""Options"" and then refresh the list and then your copied and pasted music will show up, otherwise you will be figuring out why it does not show up after a while, you need to manually refresh the music library!I added somore more apps like a flashlight and games, etc. It is 100% working and a nice little phone. However, my main phone is a Samsung Nexus S 4G from Sprint because it is a PURE GOOGLE experience on android, it is faster and smoother, and because I rely on gmail and Google calendar and Google everything apps, it just works for me. This C6 is a travel phone for me, for example I also have a Motorola Ming A1200 flip phone I used in Europe and the C6 will also be a travel phone for me when I do not need to take my larger Nexus S 4G with me traveling. So the C6 is powered off, all set up, and stored away in my closet until my next travel trip (the last time I took it I went to Idaho and Oregon on business) because the battery life on the C6 lasts a whole day+, the flip phone Ming A1200 was even better, a few days battery. The Nexus S 4G I charge every night and can't beat the apps and user experience on nexus S.Recommendation is 3 stars now from 2 stars. I would recommended it but would advise of the heft and the white screen. Everything works on it though, but with MS Exchange you can only add one email address so I have a MS Exchange address and a Gmail address, which is basically what I need for email.11/1/2010 UPDATE: HAD THIS PHONE FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW, THE ""WHITE SCREEN"" BETWEEN SWITCHING SCREENS, ETC IS GETTING ANNOYING NOW, FOR $300+ OR SO I PAID FOR THIS PHONE I EXPECT A FASTER PROCESSOR. I AM CHANGING MY STARS FROM 4 TO 2; I WOULD NOT BUY THIS IF I KNEW HOW ANNOYINGLY THIS WHITE SCREEN WOULD BE.I am reviewing Nokia C6 here first since I had time to play with it, I will review the N900 soon in a bit under the N900 product site on Amazon (I reviewed the N900 on 10/13/10 so look for it under my ""Kingmonkey"" ID). The C6 . . . I couldn't decide between Nokia N900 and C6 (did not want new N8 coming out end of September 2010 since there was no physical keyboard), so I bought both N900 and C6. Phones do not come with a case to hold, which is a disappointment considering how much each phone costs. For some reason Nokia only sells OEM cases for these phones to the European market, if you go to Amazon UK site or Nokia EU site you will see cases made for N900 and C6, so I had to go to Amazon UK site to order an OEM case for N900; the C6 on Nokia EU site has some nice ones but could not find them on Amazon UK and on Nokia EU site I cannot order them online being from the USA as you need to go to a retail location in Europe. Anyway got some generic case (more like a pouch) for the C6 from Amazon UK.The C6 is a nice looking, stylish phone, good size phone, not too thick or long at all, it's fairly small and fits in your shirt pocket if you are a guy. Made of quality materials and feels like a quality product from the weight of the phone and also when you slide the keyboard out, it is stiff and not moving about. The top row keyboard key is a little close to the top half of the phone so when you type your thumb hits the top and gets in the way; not a deal breaker for me as I just learn to adapt. Those with bigger hands (fingers) may find the keyboard a little cramped but I wanted a smaller smart phone compared to the other ones out there such as Samsung Galaxy or Motorola Droid, so it is expected to be smaller overall as that is part of the appeal. Physically that was the only issue, again, Nokia is stylish, smart looking, and as always, love their Nokia ringtone theme. One last thing on the physical side, being a middle of the road phone (between N8 and lower end Nokia phones) it doe snot have al of the bells and whistles hence the lower price. One feature I wish it had, like the more higher end N900, is a camera lens cover, the camera is just exposed to dust, etc; the C6 does come with a factory ""screen protector"" and since this is a new phone and you can't buy a screen protector just yet I suggest leaving it on to protect the screen, since after I set up the C6, the screen protector is scratched from my use of the phone (normal use with fingers swiping back and forth, mind you, I take care of my nice things, gently putting it down, wrapping it in napkin until my pouch comes in the mail, wash my hands and dry them, no lotion, before I handled my phone), so even with all of this the screen still gets scratched slightly if you look at it at an angle. Anyway will need to buy a screen protector when they are available and hopefully the one that came with it will last.On the software side, the 2GB microsd chip only holds the California map and voice navigation (street names + male voice both for US as two separate files); that's about 2GB total. If you want all of US and other countries, need to buy a 16GB microsd but even with this not sure if it can hold all the maps as you will need to delete some still as some maps are several gigs(I think 16GB additional gigs is the limit the C6 can handle for a microsd card). I don't travel a lot outside of California so it does the job and don't need to buy a bigger sized microsd card for now, I can wait until I need it and by then the microsd card price will go down.The other major issue is I use Google calendar, right now you can use MS exchange to set up google mail, calendar and contacts but it imports ALL of my gmail contacts into my C6 even though I don't actively keep in touch with all of them, I suppose you can choose to update only calendar and gmail and skip the contacts, don't remember if this is an option. The calendar also only updates my main Calendar so others I created, including Holidays calendars, bill due date calendars, etc do NOT get imported. This was a deal breaker for me so I deleted this newly created/added gmail account and all of the contacts and email and calendar got deleted, which is what I wanted and it went back to how it was, being empty. By the way when you import this way, any contacts or information you had in the calendar gets overridden with the new import, so my one contact I created with a photo and all got overridden with the import. I had to reenter it. Anyway my workaround is to use instead of MS Exchange option on Nokia to add Google accounts like gmail and calendar, etc, I used the ""Gmail"" option via the email icon to set up the email account and it works well. As for Google calendar, there is a Google Mobile site and one bookmark webpage you can set up is for Google Calendar, so for my Internet application I set my default homepage as the Google calendar address so when I want to look at ALL (holidays, bills, color coded too) of my Google calendars I just open up that bookmarked web page homepage and it is there updated in real time by Google. As for the Ovi calendar, don't use it, maybe I'll look at it just to see what day it is every sooften. So I get my Google calendar but via a webpage site, not the Ovi calendar because like I said the MS Exchange way to sync gmail mail and calendar and contacts only gives you the main calendar, no other calendars created as discussed above.I also downloaded OVI software to my PC and the linking between the C6 and Ovi software on my PC works well, this is how you sync the photos, maps, contacts, etc from your PC to the C6, also faster way to update your C6 with software updates since you download them from the PC first and then link your C6 to the PC via a USB cable and the data transfer is faster. Otherwise you would have to do it over airwaves on the C6, which is slower even using 3G but you can connect to wifi if available using the C6.I customized my desktop icons, which is pretty cool, I added a couple rows of frequent contacts, then 3rd row from top Gmail, then a couple row of shortcuts below such as web access, a bookmarked web page, calc, camera, last row has messaging icon, then I downloaded an app for messaging, including google talk, from the Ovi app store by searching for ""messaging""--it's called Nimbuzz and with this you choose your account type, Google talk, Yahoo messenger, whatever . . . at first I was lookign and looking for Google Talk app but it does not exist, you have to access Google talk through this 3rd party app Nimbuzz or something else equivalent (it was a free app) and it works perfectly fine. The C6 home screen icons,being Symbian software based, is a bit ""cartoonish"" when compared to more sophisticated phones like the N900 or Droid icons or Blackberry 9000 Bold, but it's fine and the learning curve is not steep to learn to master the C6 menu and navigation as discussed above.Overall I am happy with the Nokia, good size, small bar type smart phone, good looking, quality materials. The C6 is Symbian based and my N900 is Maemo based so another reason I bought both to compare and see how I like them.

"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (Black)","Nokia","59.95","3","04/05/2012 UPDATE: I want to do a quick comparison between the Nokia C6-00 and Android phones, specifically Samsung Nexus S by Google. I've been using the Google android phone for the past 11 months and it did EVERYTHING I needed it to do from paying for Starbucks coffee using a Starbucks app so I didn't need to carry my Starbucks card around and accessing multiple MS Exchange accounts to the interface and OS being slick and nimble as well as Google directions/mapping/GPS; the MAJOR downside to smartphones such as Android and others is the fact that they are battery drainers because of the intense use of power for the OS and display especially. I could not last more than 6-8 hours on Android and this is with setting the Display to the lowest brightness at all times which is a pain when outdoors in bright sunlight. That was the ONLY issue with my Android. Anyway, it did everything I needed so I stuck with it. Until recently the sounds stopped working. So I sold it and now I am back with Nokia. The strength of Nokia is the battery lasts a good 14-15 hours on standby (not sure why this Amazon description states 16 days or so, no, 15 hours, so at the end of the day before going to bed, you need to charge it up again for the next day). I can only add ONE MS Exchange email account on Nokia and I also have Gmail installed. The OS is not as slick and fast as Android and there is a ""white screen"" lag, but you put up with it. The sounds, ringing, call quality and reliability of the Nokia as a PHONE first and foremost is second to none. The Android (Samsung) had low ringing volume even at maximum. Also Sprint service for the Android was weak in my area, so ATT under Nokia was better. The Nokia is a ""workhorse"" of a phone that is loud (volume, I like!) and does a barely ok job at being a 'smart phone.' I will keep using it for now because of long battery life and I can switch out the SIM card to my flip phone using the same data plan for traveling using a small flip phone, esp. overseas like Europe (ATT only charges $10 month for unlimited data since it is not considered a smart phone versus minimum $30 for smart phone). Will I eventually switch to a smart phone when something I like comes out, YES, of course, the Android experience (except for battery life) did EVERYTHING I needed a smartphone to do (rich apps for banking, Starbucks, etc) and my LIFESTYLE. What will I look for in a smart phone next time? STRONG BATTERY LIFE (EASILY LASTING 15 HOURS ON STANDBY OR BASICALLY WHAT I CALL A 'WHOLE DAY' BEFORE CHARGING AT NIGHT), LOUD RINGER AND VOLUME, 4G CAPABILITY, HANDLE MULTIPLE MS EXCHANGE EMAIL ACCOUNTS.06/20/2011 UPDATE: Bought this phone in September 2010. There is still a slight lag (in the form of a ""white screen"") in between applications but other than this and the slight heft (weight) to the phone, it is a good sized pull out keyboard phone. For a while the Ovi maps and Ovi store apps did not work, I finally figured out I needed to delete the old files from apps manager and redownload Ovi maps and Ovi store. The trick is it is a Catch 22, you cannot download Ovi maps with Ovi store (the PC sync did not work for me in the first place), and you cannot if Ovi store did not work, I finally went to the browser and searched download ovi store and did it that way and once I go Ovi store working, downloaded Ovi maps and then everything works now. The music was a trick, you need to sync to your PC and copy and paste to the C6 after created a ""Music"" folder, then in the C6 press music and then library and then ""Options"" and then refresh the list and then your copied and pasted music will show up, otherwise you will be figuring out why it does not show up after a while, you need to manually refresh the music library!I added somore more apps like a flashlight and games, etc. It is 100% working and a nice little phone. However, my main phone is a Samsung Nexus S 4G from Sprint because it is a PURE GOOGLE experience on android, it is faster and smoother, and because I rely on gmail and Google calendar and Google everything apps, it just works for me. This C6 is a travel phone for me, for example I also have a Motorola Ming A1200 flip phone I used in Europe and the C6 will also be a travel phone for me when I do not need to take my larger Nexus S 4G with me traveling. So the C6 is powered off, all set up, and stored away in my closet until my next travel trip (the last time I took it I went to Idaho and Oregon on business) because the battery life on the C6 lasts a whole day+, the flip phone Ming A1200 was even better, a few days battery. The Nexus S 4G I charge every night and can't beat the apps and user experience on nexus S.Recommendation is 3 stars now from 2 stars. I would recommended it but would advise of the heft and the white screen. Everything works on it though, but with MS Exchange you can only add one email address so I have a MS Exchange address and a Gmail address, which is basically what I need for email.11/1/2010 UPDATE: HAD THIS PHONE FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW, THE ""WHITE SCREEN"" BETWEEN SWITCHING SCREENS, ETC IS GETTING ANNOYING NOW, FOR $300+ OR SO I PAID FOR THIS PHONE I EXPECT A FASTER PROCESSOR. I AM CHANGING MY STARS FROM 4 TO 2; I WOULD NOT BUY THIS IF I KNEW HOW ANNOYINGLY THIS WHITE SCREEN WOULD BE.I am reviewing Nokia C6 here first since I had time to play with it, I will review the N900 soon in a bit under the N900 product site on Amazon (I reviewed the N900 on 10/13/10 so look for it under my ""Kingmonkey"" ID). The C6 . . . I couldn't decide between Nokia N900 and C6 (did not want new N8 coming out end of September 2010 since there was no physical keyboard), so I bought both N900 and C6. Phones do not come with a case to hold, which is a disappointment considering how much each phone costs. For some reason Nokia only sells OEM cases for these phones to the European market, if you go to Amazon UK site or Nokia EU site you will see cases made for N900 and C6, so I had to go to Amazon UK site to order an OEM case for N900; the C6 on Nokia EU site has some nice ones but could not find them on Amazon UK and on Nokia EU site I cannot order them online being from the USA as you need to go to a retail location in Europe. Anyway got some generic case (more like a pouch) for the C6 from Amazon UK.The C6 is a nice looking, stylish phone, good size phone, not too thick or long at all, it's fairly small and fits in your shirt pocket if you are a guy. Made of quality materials and feels like a quality product from the weight of the phone and also when you slide the keyboard out, it is stiff and not moving about. The top row keyboard key is a little close to the top half of the phone so when you type your thumb hits the top and gets in the way; not a deal breaker for me as I just learn to adapt. Those with bigger hands (fingers) may find the keyboard a little cramped but I wanted a smaller smart phone compared to the other ones out there such as Samsung Galaxy or Motorola Droid, so it is expected to be smaller overall as that is part of the appeal. Physically that was the only issue, again, Nokia is stylish, smart looking, and as always, love their Nokia ringtone theme. One last thing on the physical side, being a middle of the road phone (between N8 and lower end Nokia phones) it doe snot have al of the bells and whistles hence the lower price. One feature I wish it had, like the more higher end N900, is a camera lens cover, the camera is just exposed to dust, etc; the C6 does come with a factory ""screen protector"" and since this is a new phone and you can't buy a screen protector just yet I suggest leaving it on to protect the screen, since after I set up the C6, the screen protector is scratched from my use of the phone (normal use with fingers swiping back and forth, mind you, I take care of my nice things, gently putting it down, wrapping it in napkin until my pouch comes in the mail, wash my hands and dry them, no lotion, before I handled my phone), so even with all of this the screen still gets scratched slightly if you look at it at an angle. Anyway will need to buy a screen protector when they are available and hopefully the one that came with it will last.On the software side, the 2GB microsd chip only holds the California map and voice navigation (street names + male voice both for US as two separate files); that's about 2GB total. If you want all of US and other countries, need to buy a 16GB microsd but even with this not sure if it can hold all the maps as you will need to delete some still as some maps are several gigs(I think 16GB additional gigs is the limit the C6 can handle for a microsd card). I don't travel a lot outside of California so it does the job and don't need to buy a bigger sized microsd card for now, I can wait until I need it and by then the microsd card price will go down.The other major issue is I use Google calendar, right now you can use MS exchange to set up google mail, calendar and contacts but it imports ALL of my gmail contacts into my C6 even though I don't actively keep in touch with all of them, I suppose you can choose to update only calendar and gmail and skip the contacts, don't remember if this is an option. The calendar also only updates my main Calendar so others I created, including Holidays calendars, bill due date calendars, etc do NOT get imported. This was a deal breaker for me so I deleted this newly created/added gmail account and all of the contacts and email and calendar got deleted, which is what I wanted and it went back to how it was, being empty. By the way when you import this way, any contacts or information you had in the calendar gets overridden with the new import, so my one contact I created with a photo and all got overridden with the import. I had to reenter it. Anyway my workaround is to use instead of MS Exchange option on Nokia to add Google accounts like gmail and calendar, etc, I used the ""Gmail"" option via the email icon to set up the email account and it works well. As for Google calendar, there is a Google Mobile site and one bookmark webpage you can set up is for Google Calendar, so for my Internet application I set my default homepage as the Google calendar address so when I want to look at ALL (holidays, bills, color coded too) of my Google calendars I just open up that bookmarked web page homepage and it is there updated in real time by Google. As for the Ovi calendar, don't use it, maybe I'll look at it just to see what day it is every sooften. So I get my Google calendar but via a webpage site, not the Ovi calendar because like I said the MS Exchange way to sync gmail mail and calendar and contacts only gives you the main calendar, no other calendars created as discussed above.I also downloaded OVI software to my PC and the linking between the C6 and Ovi software on my PC works well, this is how you sync the photos, maps, contacts, etc from your PC to the C6, also faster way to update your C6 with software updates since you download them from the PC first and then link your C6 to the PC via a USB cable and the data transfer is faster. Otherwise you would have to do it over airwaves on the C6, which is slower even using 3G but you can connect to wifi if available using the C6.I customized my desktop icons, which is pretty cool, I added a couple rows of frequent contacts, then 3rd row from top Gmail, then a couple row of shortcuts below such as web access, a bookmarked web page, calc, camera, last row has messaging icon, then I downloaded an app for messaging, including google talk, from the Ovi app store by searching for ""messaging""--it's called Nimbuzz and with this you choose your account type, Google talk, Yahoo messenger, whatever . . . at first I was lookign and looking for Google Talk app but it does not exist, you have to access Google talk through this 3rd party app Nimbuzz or something else equivalent (it was a free app) and it works perfectly fine. The C6 home screen icons,being Symbian software based, is a bit ""cartoonish"" when compared to more sophisticated phones like the N900 or Droid icons or Blackberry 9000 Bold, but it's fine and the learning curve is not steep to learn to master the C6 menu and navigation as discussed above.Overall I am happy with the Nokia, good size, small bar type smart phone, good looking, quality materials. The C6 is Symbian based and my N900 is Maemo based so another reason I bought both to compare and see how I like them. C6 works with ATT 3G so since I have an existing ATT SIM card it works great, the N900 I signed up for a T-Mobile individual plan text+web+voice and the N900 3G only works with TMobile 3G, So I am set here; if I used the ATT SIM card the ATT 3G does not work with Nokia N900 and would have to settle for EDGE (non 3G).

I am not a huge fan of smartphones. I just want a phone to do what a phone is supposed to do - call and text! This phone is straightforward and simple to use. The buttons are big, and are easy to push without pushing more than one at a time. It is a step above a plain phone; it has a calender and allows the creation of a ""to-do list"" - I don't use it, but I'm sure it would come in handy for someone. It's design is sleek and easily slips into my pocket. The back of the phone is metal, and so far has been goof-proof! It has already endured 2 drops. The entire bottom of the phone is a speaker. The speaker is loud and has a little bass to it. The two megapixel camera is decent, it's a little shaky - but that may just be me. The light show on it is pretty cool too. It gets good reception, and is loud and clear... a big problem I encountered with my iPhone. All-in-all I love this phone! If you're looking for a great flip phone that is durable and easy to use I would definitely recommend this product!","58","helpful"
"Nokia 6350 Unlocked GSM Flip Phone with Second External TFT Display, 2MP Camera, Video, Internet Browser, GPS, Bluetooth, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - Red","Nokia","269.1","5","I used my first Nokia 6250 for almost five years. My husband and I looked at the new iPhone but I could barely read the fine print on the small screen. I do not eMail, text, surf the internet or listen to music on a phone so do not want a data plan, just a simple phone that can hold my address book.My husband was in an ICU when the my first Nokia 6250 finally had to be replaced. I put the sim card into my husband's Blackberri and used it for a frustrating six weeks: The tiny keys were difficult for my arthritic fingers to use, it was not nearly as comfortable to hold as the Nokia, and I'd never use most of it's features. I finally gave up on it and found this phone on Amazon.I'm again happy to have a phone that meets my simple communication needs, is comfortable in my hand and easy to use. I then purchased a mini iPad with a data plan. It is SO much easier to read and use than the ""smart phones, and it easily slips into my purse. For me, this is the best of both worlds!","59","helpful"

I used to carry 2 phones at work, one for work, one personal. It got to be a pain, but due to the type of work I do, I don't really want to be giving out my personal cell number. With this phone, I put both SIM cards in and away I went. Syncs with Microsoft account and Exchange server at work.Pros: Text and phone messages can be sent on designated lines. Phone is fast and responsive. EXCELLENT camera! Syncs with Microsoft account. Huge 5 inch screen.Cons: Only one ring tone. Cant customize SIM ring tones. Edit: To clarify, the phone allows you to use as many ring tones as you would like. You can assign different ring tones to each contact. What I originally meant was, There is currently no way to give each SIM its own ring tone. Specifically to have SIM1 sound different from SIM2. I would like to be able to tell by the tone if the incoming call is from my personal or work line.","75","helpful"
"Nokia C2-01.5 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Music and Video Player--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)","Nokia","98","5","The Nokia C2-01 is a feature phone. It does not do the web well. The 3G on this phone is pretty slow on AT&T when compared to the iPhone, and the interface is not touch screen. If you want those things, you should buy the iPhone. It's a cool phone, and you can play sweet games about birds and tweet a picture of the panini you are eating for dinner on Twitter, no problem.After a week, I am in love with this phone. It takes good-enough pictures, does Gmail pretty well, has great bluetooth connectivity, and plays my music. I can tether my iPad and computer to its data connection (AT&T) at no extra cost. The data connection is not fast but it gives me the web anywhere when I want it and, more importantly, its limited connectivity/non-touchscreenness helps me forget the web when I'm with my family.As a former iPhone user, I used to make fun of people with feature phones. Now, it seems like I'm more aware of actual life when I'm out getting my pizza party on with the wife and kids. Instead of sitting face-down in some Facebook with stuff going on around me, my phone stays in my pocket and my attention stays on what's important.It's not the phone for everyone, but it helps me be a better dad.If you feel distracted by your technology, but still want to retain some connectivity (for work or even with other gadgets), this is not a bad choice. And it's cheap.","80","helpful"

"Nokia Lumia 900 AT&T GSM Unlocked 4G LTE Windows 7.5 Smartphone - Cyan Blue","Nokia","129.95","5","This phone is great! It's the best phone I've ever owned. I have been a dedicated high end Android user, but I found this phone to be a much more satisfying experience than either the iPhone or the Android phones. I want an OS that will meet my current needs and have a great user interface with a good amount of apps available for me to manage my daily mobile cell phone use, and not have to make expensive phone upgrades all the time. The Nokia Lumia 900 is a very well constructed phone.The aesthetics are pleasing, it's modern and function goes well beyond my expectations. It operates very fast and smooth even though it has a single core processor and only 512MB on RAM. If you are not aware of these specs, you might think it has a multi-core processor and more RAM on board. Nokia has come up with a phone that is both pleasing in design and very efficient when it comes to performance. The screen is bright with beautiful color saturated screen, and seems to have less glare outside when it's sunny. I can actually read the screen in such conditions. This is a big plus for me! It has 16GB of ROM, which is plenty by itself, but pared with the 7GB of frees cloud storage, it's more than enough for me. I really don't know what the fuss is about concerning the number of apps available for Windows Phones. Unless you are some kind of developer or techy person, there are plenty of apps available for this phone (both from MS, Nokia and third party) for the everyday cell phone user, even business user. The game apps seems so much more refined (probably because there are a lot of Xbox games available for this phone) and they run beautifully on this phone. I travel a lot and I'm really looking forward to using this phone on my trips. I have always liked Nokia phones because of the quality build and support. When I started using a smartphone I got away from Nokia phones and started my Android experience. Now that Nokia has chosen to team up with MS to re-enter the smartphone market, I wanted to try their phones again. What a lovely surprise! I'm crazy for the Lumia 900 and look forward to future offerings from Nokia, if and when I get tired of this phone or need to upgrade. I recommend this phone, it's quality at affordable prices. Great design, sturdy, fast and very easy to use, especially if you run Windows 8 on your computer. Try it! You won't be sorry. By it from Amazon, the best place to shop and that's coming from a person that doesn't or ever has worked for them. I forgot to tell you that there is an upgrade of the operating system to 7.8, which is very similar to Windows 8, available for this phone. It's very easy to install, just install Zune on your Windows computer, connect your phone to USB, and it will find the upgrade and instruct you how to install.","81","helpful"
"Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone","Nokia","59.95","4","First off I love the phone after I got everything figured out. Basically all I had to do was pop my sim card out of my existing (AT&T Customer) phone and I was good to go, sort of! lol From that point I could call my contacts, send text messages, and even connect to the internet via wifi. Now the problems I discovered shortly there after was it connected to the wifi but could not go to any webpages because it would time out. It would not even go to the nokia pre-loaded store icon on the phone. Well, I could tell that there was settings not configured somewhere because it is unlocked for different carriers and needed at&t settings entered. Another problem I encountered was I could send text and recieve them just fine but could not recieve or send pictures with text messages succesfully. That was aggrevating because I could do that with my old phone just fine, but not this one. I found the solutions to fix these problems on-line after searching for awhile.

"Nokia E63-2 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Ultramarine Blue)","Nokia","286","5","I want to start off saying that after using multiple phones over the years, I find this to be one of my top phones I have ever used.By being unlocked from the start, the phone is completely umbranded, meaning you don't have all of the cute AT&T or T-Mobile logos everywhere, and have complete access to all of the settings that most providers will restrict you from changing. You also have 110MB of space free on the phone (a ton) for basic apps, and of course you can buy a MicroSD card for even more memory.The phone itself looks great. The blue color is actually an extremely dark navy, and can look black in most cases. As for the thickness compared to the e71, I think it actually feels better in your hand, and isn't that noticeable. The headphone jack is a great touch, allowing you to use any headphone set you want.As for the software, it uses the Symbian 9.2 Feature Pack 1, and includes software you can use to open and edit Word and Excel documents on the go. The built in music player is decent, and set up like an Ipod with its ability to have playlists, genre searches etc. You can even download the free Divx player and watch movies to go! Then theres the Nokia Ovi store. Sort of like the App Store for the iPone, you can download apps directly from Nokia, although at the moment due to its recent launch, there aren't that many things (especially free) being offered.The WiFi was the deal sealer for me. Living on a college campus which has wireless internet all over, I didn't want to have to pay to have internet and email on my phone. Its fast (compared to a friend's iPone, about the same speed)and it is great for surfing, along with using the build-in YouTube application.There is a ton of great free software on the web for the phone if you look for it, things like weather applications, instant messaging, mapping software (requires either a WiFi or a data plan to use) etc.I find the speakerphone loud and clear, and good enough to play music over.The keyboard is absolutely amazing. I haven't experience many misspellings while using it, compared to my past palm treo I had. The keys are comfortable and easy to press down.Battery life is great on this. I was able to get 5 days out of a charge with light usage (30 texts per day, maybe 20 minutes on the phone per day and 10-15 minutes per day surfing using the WiFi)The cons I've found:Nokia still hasn't set up a threaded text messaging system as default (IM style chats). My Windows Mobile phone from 4 years ago has this feature, and Nokia has their own application which does this, but you cannot set it as the default Txt messaging.Weak vibration feature. I can barley feel it. My previous Nokia was weak as well though.The Operating System (Symbian) does not assume or remember any connection settings. If you open your web browser, each time it will ask you what connection you want to use. It can get annoying if you are constantly in the same place.Other Tips I've foundIf you don't have a data plan, go into the Network settings and change it to be GSM Only (NOT UMTS). UMTS is 3G, and you will get better battery life using GSM only with no downsides if not using the data plan.To change volume with internet radio, press the function key, and then the up and down keys change the volume.In media player, you can start typing the name of a song or artist using the keyboard and it will show up.","87","helpful"
"Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty","Nokia","99.99","5","First, a little background, for perspective: I'm an ex-iphone user, migrated from iphone to Android a few years ago, for the freedom and open-ness of the OS. I've really liked the Android OS and the phones I've bought along the way. A few months ago I bought a Lumia 521 with a new Metro PCS account. The Lumia 521 introduced me to Windows 8 Phone OS and I was amazed at how fluid, intuitive and FUN it is - so I decided to fork out for a premium Windows Phone ... which is what brought me to the Lumia 820.The NOKIA LUMIA 820 is SOLID. It's heavy in the hand and has a stable, durable feel to it. The display is vibrant and beautiful. Reviewers and ""experts"" out there on the web can say anything they want about resolution, rag on the pixel density, whatever - but this phone, in your hand is BEAUTIFUL. Colors pop, photos are crisp and videos look great!As was the case with my (brief) experience on the Lumia 521, this is quick, nimble, FAST. Every operation is there when called for, tasks present themselves immediately and close just as quickly. There's something about this Windows OS that must be much less resource-intensive, less hungry than other mobile OS's, because things just pop and fly all over the place.The Tiles ... live tiles, that represent what feels like a living, breathing OS Interface. You see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the ""People"" tile ... Facebook posts of friends ""pop up"" in live time, as they are happening ... News updates circulate in a tile, the tile suddenly flips over to reveal another breaking headline ... the tile from your Songza app suddenly flips over to say ""It is Friday Night"" (or late Saturday morning, etc.) ... the Photos tile rotates through your albums, scrolling slowly and continuously ... nothing stands still, this tiled-interface is alive!More on Tiles ... you can size and re-size your tiles, according to taste; regular (square), large (rectangle that covers width of the screen) or small (one quarter size of regular). You can even Pin your favorite websites to the screen, each in a tile of it's own. I've got four favorite Playlists (from Nokia Music) pinned to my screen, each re-sized to small, and they form a little music ""block"", the size of a regular tile!The Lumia 820 has NFC capability and Wireless Charging - something I didn't think I'd ever need or use, but I did fork out for the charging plate and it's been a very nice bonus. I've already grown lazy, with the ability to simply place the phone on it's back for a charge ... no plugs, cables or hassles.CUSTOMIZATION! Unlike other phones in the Lumia lineup, this one has interchangeable back plates. Once in place, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate. You can make this a Cyan phone, a bright Red phone, Yellow, White or Black, simply by putting a different (removable) back plate on it. You can order these with or without NFC and Wireless Charging capability. This phone was black when I bought it, I've since changed it to Cyan (and have other colors on order).Is the 920 a better phone? How about the 928? Well, the specs are better on those phones, but for me, this is the sweet spot. It's smaller than the 920, but with the same screen size, and (again), with the joy of body / color customization. Processing speed? System RAM? What are those??? What do I care? When a phone is as fast, fluid, stable and zippy as this is, who cares? When you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this, you can forget about specs (and forget the ""expert"" opinions from the tech sites). None of it matters.Apps ... yes, you hear a lot of whining, complaining, hand-wringing criticism of the Windows app store and it's ""horrible dearth of apps"". If you believe what you read out there on the internet, you probably figure they've got about 10 or 20 apps in the store. I don't know WHO these people are, or WHAT they have on their own phones, but inasmuch as the Windows store has over a hundred thousand apps (126,000 as of last night) ... I feel that is enough for me (and for any reasonable person). Sure, you can bolster your app store to a million, 50 million, a billion, whatever - but when 50,000 of those apps are flashlights (as opposed to one flashlight), how is that improving your app experience?The 8GB of internal space ... once the OS requirements are subtracted, you've got about 5 or 6 gigs to yourself. Unlike it's bigger brethren in the Lumia family, this one comes with a Micro SD slot. I've got a 32GB card in mine, and have set the phone to load all photos, music and videos to the card (rather than to internal storage). That should hold me for awhile.The Camera ... with Carl Zeiss optics and Dual LED Flash, the 8.7 megapixel camera and quality of your photos will be excellent. I've also loaded an HDR app from the store and have experimented with it, garnering some very nice results. I've been taking photos for Instagram, Foodspotting, Facebook and Twitter so far, nothing that requires a critical eye or instrument. I have also set my phone to auto-upload all photos and videos to Skydrive, so I've got an instant backup of everything I've taken.I'm not going to spend any time hashing-out or ""reviewing"" technical details, you'll get plenty of that in other reviews (and websites). Suffice it to say, this is one of the best and THE most enjoyable phone I've ever owned.","90","helpful"

Unlike other phones in the Lumia lineup, this one has interchangeable back plates. Once in place, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate. You can make this a Cyan phone, a bright Red phone, Yellow, White or Black, simply by putting a different (removable) back plate on it. You can order these with or without NFC and Wireless Charging capability. This phone was black when I bought it, I've since changed it to Cyan (and have other colors on order).Is the 920 a better phone? How about the 928? Well, the specs are better on those phones, but for me, this is the sweet spot. It's smaller than the 920, but with the same screen size, and (again), with the joy of body / color customization. Processing speed? System RAM? What are those??? What do I care? When a phone is as fast, fluid, stable and zippy as this is, who cares? When you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this, you can forget about specs (and forget the ""expert"" opinions from the tech sites). None of it matters.Apps ... yes, you hear a lot of whining, complaining, hand-wringing criticism of the Windows app store and it's ""horrible dearth of apps"". If you believe what you read out there on the internet, you probably figure they've got about 10 or 20 apps in the store. I don't know WHO these people are, or WHAT they have on their own phones, but inasmuch as the Windows store has over a hundred thousand apps (126,000 as of last night) ... I feel that is enough for me (and for any reasonable person). Sure, you can bolster your app store to a million, 50 million, a billion, whatever - but when 50,000 of those apps are flashlights (as opposed to one flashlight), how is that improving your app experience?The 8GB of internal space ... once the OS requirements are subtracted, you've got about 5 or 6 gigs to yourself. Unlike it's bigger brethren in the Lumia family, this one comes with a Micro SD slot. I've got a 32GB card in mine, and have set the phone to load all photos, music and videos to the card (rather than to internal storage). That should hold me for awhile.The Camera ... with Carl Zeiss optics and Dual LED Flash, the 8.7 megapixel camera and quality of your photos will be excellent. I've also loaded an HDR app from the store and have experimented with it, garnering some very nice results. I've been taking photos for Instagram, Foodspotting, Facebook and Twitter so far, nothing that requires a critical eye or instrument. I have also set my phone to auto-upload all photos and videos to Skydrive, so I've got an instant backup of everything I've taken.I'm not going to spend any time hashing-out or ""reviewing"" technical details, you'll get plenty of that in other reviews (and websites). Suffice it to say, this is one of the best and THE most enjoyable phone I've ever owned.","90","helpful"

T-Mobile 3G in the US uses the 1700 mhz spectrum (you can read on wikipedia as for the reasons why) and there are no 3G roaming agreements with AT&Ts 3G spectrum like there is with EDGE. That being said, I have found that EDGE is fast enough for my web browsing and e-mail use (220 kbps+.) Using GSM/EDGE only also more than doubles your battery life, so this is not an entirely bad thing for T-Mobile users. The 10 hours talk-time and 17 day standby is no joke with GSM either.Network Settings -- Nokia has a great website that will text you all the internet, voicemail, and MMS settings for your carrier to the unlocked phone.Bluetooth Tethering -- This phone does not tether with Mac OS 10.4 Tiger. It does tether perfectly with 10.5 Leopard. It tethers with Windows XP via included Nokia PC Suite. It would be nice if a Mac suite were included from Nokia but Apple provides everything necessary with Leopard. It obviously tethers perfectly with Nokia N800/N810.GPS -- The GPS in the phone is first class with both an actual GPS receiver and assisted GPS through cell tower. It works much better than my TomTom One especially indoors. The phone comes with a great program called Maps but the only drawback (and it is a HUGE drawback) is that you have to pay a monthly fee to use any sort of route guidance. You're allowed to see your position and browse maps for free but if you want to plan a route it costs extra. It comes with a 7 day trial that you should save for emergencies in my opinion.Networks in General -- This phone works great on both AT&T and T-Mobile but each has their drawbacks. AT&T has the faster network but limits you to 5Gb/month bandwidth and charges extra to tether. T-Mobile allows actual unlimited data on EDGE and allows free tethering to any device but has the slower ""2.75G"" EDGE data network. Wifi is available on the phone and works flawlessly.Third Party Apps -- Two must have apps are the S60 Divx player and the Slick IM client (AIM, Jabber, Etc.) The Nokia mail client works great and a third party solution is not necessary.All in all this is a first class phone whose only missing feature is a touch screen. Depending on your need for a QWERTY keyboard I would say this and the N95 are battling it out for best phone in the world right now.","126","helpful"

"Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)","Nokia","99.99","4","I upgraded from a Nokia E71 (which was an unbelievable upgrade from my previous experiences with Blackberry), and for some reason I was expecting that same leap from the E71 to E72. However, I soon realized, after using my E72 for the past couple days, that the E71 did in fact spoil me. The E72 is still no doubt an amazing phone -- along with the E71 and other top Nokias, it's still in its own little league above the Blackberries and other smartphones -- but I'll admit I was slightly let down.If you are looking to buy a Nokia (or any phone) I'd definitely recommend the E72. If you are a huge Nokia fan, then fine, upgrade. If you're happy with your E71....then I'd really think about it (or at least get your hands on one in person). The E72 is much faster, the camera's awesome, and it's still a beautiful phone. BUT you should know a couple things:-The construction is not quite as top-notch as the E71. It's a little lighter, with some metal replaced for a sort of heavy, hardened plastic. I've heard of the battery panel being loose, but I haven't run into the problem. Mine was made in China, while my E71 was made in Finland, although it seems there can always be problems no matter where it's made.-The optical pad is a nice touch (it takes some getting used to) and, occasionally, it can misinterpret your choice to click to the side for a sliding movement. But overall I'm getting used to it (and if you really don't like it you can always switch it off).-I do notice the slightest high pitched buzz when the volume is turned up and the sound coming from the other end of the call is on the loud side. The E71 never had this problem. I take it the speakers were either downgraded or because of the extra plastic there's some sort of vibration (could just be my model). UPDATE: Seems the speaker just needed some ""breaking in"" (strange, I know). This problem is no longer present. However, still not the best volume in speakerphone mode.***Overall, I'd say if you're looking at the E72 compared to any top smartphone, this is an excellent choice***IF you're looking at the E72 and E71 side by side, it is THEN that you start to notice the little details that I mentioned above. True, there are a few more plastic pieces than the E71, but when I think about the Blackberries and iPhones, you're never going to get the same quality you got with the E71, and the E72 is just a notch below that.E72 is a 4.5 star phone. E71 will always be the best phone I've ever owned.","128","helpful"

"Nokia E6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, and 8 MP Camera - Silver","Nokia","269.1","2","I have owned Nokia Symbian smartphones since the 6682, and in the E-series, I have owned the E71 and E72. I loved both the E71 and E72 phones, and I had very high expectations for their successor. Many of my expectations were met, but the phone has several serious issues that prevented me from giving a higher rating.Form Factor & Build - 10/10- Nokia really did their homework when putting together this phone. Symbian Anna is a nice evolution for a hybrid hard key and touch interface. I was skeptical at first, but I'm now seamlessly using both.- The phone feels very solid, and it feels a little stronger in my hands than even the E71. It is certainly sturdier than the E72.Battery Life - 10/10- Battery life is fantastic. As with previous E-series phones, this phone was designed to go the distance.- The battery is proportionately large and makes up more than half the width of the phone. I think that it was a good move on Nokia's part to get the extra hours and is a definite advantage over most touch screen phones. As they were still able to keep the phone small, I would say it was worth putting in the larger battery.Keyboard - 6/10The Good: - I am a hardware keyboard addict, and I loath the cell phone industry's move to all-touch phones. - In terms of feel, the E6 has another solid portrait layout keyboard from Nokia.The Bad: - I can't believe they put the apostrophe as a function access on the `L.' I would much rather have a thinner spacebar if I could still have a functional apostrophe - no question. Though not as important as the apostrophe, the double quote and parentheses were relegated to function accessed keys as well. - The `Ctrl' key now has its own, coveted bottom row position, but what's the point? The entire user guide only mentions it once, and it is supposed to help with copy and paste functionality. I didn't even remember that my E72 had this key (it was a secondary function to the `silent mode' shortcut - something foolishly done away with in the E6). - The E6 has slightly raised keys, but Nokia got rid of the domed keys from the E72 which I preferred for typing speed. - The keyboard backlight has taken a step back from previous models. By default, the backlight won't turn on in seemingly random situations and never turns on when entering the lock code - even in pitch black darkness. When I first drafted this review, I gave the keyboard a 3/10. After lots of digging and playing with settings, I found that the keyboard backlight is controlled by Menu>Settings>Phone>Display>Brightness. If you turn the brightness setting above 50%, the keyboard and screen backlights work 10x better, and the keyboard backlight is on when typing the lock code!Screen - 9/10- The screen is beautifully detailed, the color appears accurate, and the black levels are very good.- The touch interface is remarkably good. I have found it to be one of the more accurate touch screens I have used, and multitouch gestures work consistently.- I had to mark it down slightly because the default backlight setting is much too dim and gets even dimmer when the sensor deems it appropriate. The screen is beautiful when the backlight is well-illuminated, but it's hard to read when it's often too dim at the default setting.- I immediately deactivated the touchscreen vibrations as they felt cheap and were noisy.Notifications - 5/10- I really miss the `breathing light' from the previous two phones. This made the phone brilliantly easy to watch for the status of emails, sms, and calls even when the phone had to be completely silent during a meeting. There is a menu setting to enable the breathing light (off by default), but it seems to have respiratory problems as it is dim and hard to view off-axis.- I have not had any problems with the vibration as reported by other users. Symbian tailors vibrations to match audio tones even when the tones are turned off, and they might just need to make a tweak to get it working properly again.- The charging light is annoying, bright, and cannot be turned off in the settings menus. I have to cover my phone when I place it on my nightstand.- Email notifications are abysmal - More on this later.Sensors - 8/10GPS: Seems to work well as in previous models and is able to quickly lock on a signal.Electronic Compass: This is a pretty slick new feature, but it seems to be a little off. I have retried the built-in calibration every way I can think, and it still seems to be about 10degrees off. It also doesn't notice if I turn the phone 180degrees.Accelerometer: I haven't found many practical uses for this feature on the Symbian Anna phone, and I quickly disabled the feature to deny calls or turn off my alarm by `turning' the phone. This seems like a recipe for missing calls and oversleeping, and I'm surprised it is enabled by default without warning the user.Camera - 6/10- I would rather have fewer megapixels in exchange for better picture quality, and unfortunately Nokia decided to pack an unwieldy number of pixels (8MP) in the little E6. To be honest, a close inspection of the pictures makes them appear as if they have been upconverted, but this could simply be a result of trying to rescue an image from a sensor with such tiny pixels. The camera would be far better with half the megapixels, the E72's autofocus lens, and newer low-noise sensor technology rather than an 8MP pixel density on such a tiny chip.- The autofocus camera from previous models had far superior contrast and sharpness compared to this ""endless depth of field"" camera. This is important to me as I like to be able to use my cell as a document camera when traveling, something EDoF cameras are notoriously poor at. Some reviewers have reported better results with this camera when shooting portraits and landscapes, but I rarely take a photo of something further than an arm's length away.Email - 1/10 => Abysmal (I would give the E72's email an 8.5/10)Though the interface is similar to previous models, the email on the E6 has taken a huge plunge. As a reference point, I have pushed the capabilities of Nokia email for several years using four or five different accounts of various types at any given time. Nokia sold their push email company due to financial problems, and they have already removed true push capabilities from the E6.This causes a multitude of problems: - Emails take so long to arrive that carrying on an email conversation is impractical. I have conducted tests on Exchange, Gmail, and imap accounts, and the fastest arrival time was 4 minutes, the longest was 13 minutes, and the average was about 8 minutes. Compared to the E72's nearly instant email around the clock, this is a huge disappointment. It doesn't sound like long on paper, but it's a huge pain in actual use. - After buying a new phone or performing a hard reset, the phone will no longer download all settings from Nokia's secure servers. This made setting this phone up frustrating. - Unlike the quick configuration of the E72 and E71 email clients that utilized Nokia's push service, setting up all my accounts has been a nightmare on the E6. Though it quickly accepted the settings of one imap account, it still refuses to accept another. When I got into the settings, it had reset the incoming server to the smtp server (a result of sloppy coding), and it still won't work after reconfiguring all the settings. I had no trouble configuring this account on my E72. - As on previous models, only one Exchange account is allowed. This is quite frustrating for anyone who has more than one, and the workarounds (the aforementioned imap account) are ineffective and very limited.SMS - 9.5/10 (I would have ranked the system in the E71 or E72 a 3/10)- The sms interface is much improved over any Nokia device I have previously used.- The threading not only replaces free-isms which I had used previously but works even better with a cleaner interface.- I have to mark it down a half point as there are aspects of the interface that still need a little tweaking. While it has improved a great deal, the user experience design still has a little ways to go to streamline message replying, forwarding, and flow between senders, time, and the homescreen.Browsing and Tethering - 9/10 (8/10 for Browsing and 10/10 for Tethering- Symbian phones have never had great browsers, but I have always found them functional. Like previous models, the browser is a little outdated and weak, but it works for 95% of the internet. I admit that this is very frustrating in the 5% of time that demand more, but I haven't ever worried much about it as I always have a laptop to tether nearby.- The browser on the E6 is an improvement over previous models, and touch speeds up browsing.- I have to lower the rating because there are several features that are poorly designed - Several features that wouldn't make any sense to a user who hadn't previously used the keyboard only version. For example, RSS feeds can only be removed using the D-pad and backspace key, something I found immensely frustrating using touch until I remembered the keyboard way to do it.- For the record, I don't use Opera because I don't like my data tunneling through 3rd party servers - just a personal preference due to privacy management.- Tethering on this phone is top notch. Assuming you have a laptop nearby, it makes up for many of the browsing shortcomings.- Tethering speeds are much higher than speeds on the built in browser. I don't know why the built in browser is slow, but the tethering speeds are nice and fast!A note on JoikuSpot Premium: I have been a paid user of JoikuSpot Premium for several years, and I was excited to see Nokia include this package in the default lineup. This application and off-the-grid tethering are one of the E6's greatest selling points. Nokia was very wise to put this on the E6, and secure WEP tethering is really slick on the E6.Included Software - 9/10Disclaimer: I'm no app junky, and as a business user, I don't care about games.- Maps: A surprisingly robust, well written, functional application. This is definitely one of the selling points of Nokia Ovi phones that include unlimited, free navigation using Ovi Maps. It has timely information for route planning, it nicely integrates satellite and map views, and it has a great interface. With touch, I find this to be a 10/10 application. That being said, I still use Google maps for finding local businesses.- Adobe Reader & Quickoffice: Both solid programs that come in handy from time to time. 10/10- Social: This isn't a feature I have used or played with. I did try to open it briefly while writing this review, and it wouldn't die when I pressed exit. I had to turn the phone off and on to exit. meh/10- Ovi Store: The appstore is awful. If Nokia would just filter out the junk, it would be far better, but unfortunately most of the store is junk. I'm still offering a 9/10 for the software as I don't really need much more out of a cell phone than is included by default. I occasionally see something cool I wish I had (like the night sky augmented reality programs on iOS and Android), but I don't think about this often.Interface - 4/10- Home Screen: This is an unfortunate step back from previous models. To be honest, I preferred the E72 with a single homescreen to the 3 I have configured on the E6 due to the E72's responsiveness. The E6 homescreens take several seconds to update when I switch between them, and this makes flipping between them impractical. You can actually see the email application marking emails read before loading new emails as you wait to see if anything new has arrived. If you flip at a normal pace, you can flip past the screen before it has even loaded new emails.- Widgets: The E6 has added additional support for Widgets, but they aren't particularly effective. To test their functionality, I downloaded several from the Ovi store. The Accuweather takes 4 or 5 seconds to update once you flip to its homescreen (15 seconds after restarting the phone sometimes), and newsfeeds have to be manually updated. While this sounds trivial, this is something that could be easily done in the background. Complaining about 5 seconds sounds silly, but it's very frustrating to spend 15 seconds to check my three homescreens for email, the outside temperature, and my calendar.Multimedia - 10/10Radio: I have never used the FM radio on any Symbian phone I have owned.Music Player: A surprisingly good interface, and the 8GB of built-in storage + microSD allow for carrying a nice music collection. As an mp3 player, I'm surprisingly pleased and sound quality seems very good.Video Player: I think video playback looks really good! The high resolution screen really shines with video playback, and I haven't noticed any playback hiccups. However, I should mention that I'm not one to watch anything longer than a few minutes on my phone.Streaming Media - NadaThe lack of steaming multimedia options isn't Nokia's fault entirely, but it's something worth considering when buying a new phone.Streaming Netflix: This is becoming a pretty standard feature on other platforms, and it's noticeably absent when the Netflix app only allows you to modify your queue.Streaming Music: Spotify is supposed to offer some support for Symbian (haven't tried it myself), but all of the other major players including Pandora do not.Security - 9/10- I'm pretty zealous about protecting my laptop and cell phone from data theft even though it's never been a problem for me. When I consider how much of my life and identity is accessible via my mobile devices and email, it makes this an important enterprise class feature.- The E6's support for encrypting the phone, built-in mass storage, and microSD memory is commendable and really stands out. It doesn't take long to activate, and I assume it's pretty effective.- I marked down my security rating because the lock out code is so darn hard to access in the dark with the default backlight setting (you can't see the keyboard at all). This is the third time I am marking off points because the default backlight setting is too dim to see the screen or keyboard backlight.Bottom Line - 6.97/10 => 3/5 (SEE END OF REVIEW FOR UPDATED 2/5)I loved this phone when I first got it, but aspects have becoming disappointing with more use. In fact, I loved this phone so much in the first few days that I wanted to order another to replace my wife's E63! There were a few little things that were annoying at first, but I was sure they would work themselves out over time. Unfortunately, some of those irritations have become larger problems. The slow interface and asinine email service are by far the worst of any Nokia E-series device I have owned, and it's feeling like the E-series designers jumped ship with the Microsoft takeover looming.I am giving a 3/5 star rating based on increasing the backlight setting a great deal, but I would have given a 2/5 had this option not been available considering this effects so many aspects of the interface and usability. Overall, my feelings on this phone fluctuate between 2 stars (don't recommend) and 4 stars (recommend with caution), an ambiguity I don't normally feel. On one hand I love the touch/hardware hybrid, new sms interface, security features, tethering, battery life, and media player. On the other hand, I hate the email client, homescreens, notifications, widgets, streaming media, and camera. Though I have stood by the Nokia Symbian platform for years and really wanted to love this phone, I have begun to reconsider my loyalties after owning the underwhelming E6.UPDATES:- To address concerns of other reviewers concerning the vibrate mode, I put my phone in a custom 'vibrate only' profile. Though I agree that the vibrate is not particularly strong, I have found it to still be reliable. A weak vibrate has pros and cons - it's quieter, but it's also easy to miss. Remember that sometimes Symbian requires you to keep an audio ring that's turned all the way down for vibrate to work properly.- I have to tone back my glowing review of the new SMS interface. For each contact, only the last 12 messages are stored in the conversation queue (which translates to only 6 messages each). When ""Show Older Messages"" is selected, the most recent messages disappear, and dumping messages from new to old occurs automatically even when you're trying to read them. I would expect much better functionality from a phone in this class. I also believe that the SMS interface requires too many presses to navigate from a user interface perspective.- I have noticed that the touch screen doesn't work on hot, humid days. I don't know how this compares to other phones, and I don't understand this defect very well. I have found this problem to be most apparent after removing the phone from my face on humid days outdoors. The touch screen is inaccessible until the phone has sat in air conditioning for a few minutes.RETURNED:Deciding whether to keep or return a cell phone is a very personal decision, and it's not one that I can make for anyone else. Based on my demands for an enterprise class phone, the Nokia E6 couldn't hold its own. The irritations became problems, and the problems became deal-breakers. I've ultimately decided that the means don't justify the ends. The E6 fell short of my expectations after owning previous Nokia enterprise phones, but I don't know that I would have been happier if I hadn't relied on the E71 and E72 for several years. To be honest, I think I would have liked the phone even less not knowing the legacy commands, menus, and settings. Last night I ordered a ""like new,"" store returned E72 to replace my E6, and I'm looking forward to sliding it in my pocket.UPDATED NOTE ON CALL QUALITY:I have found the call quality of this phone to quickly deteriorate with use. After a month of use, calls are often either disconnected or the other caller could hear me while they sounded as if they were at the end of a long tunnel. Other phones using the same service had no trouble calling from the same location while I was losing calls or had hopeless call quality. The call quality was solid when I first wrote the above review, but use during the final two weeks of my return period showed rapid loss of signal quality.DUE TO THIS SERIOUS ISSUE, I am lowering my rating of the phone to a 2/5.","142","helpful"

I have been tempted to change to another phone but some things keep holding me back. Maybe I am just sentimental. Maybe it is regret that Nokia decided to prematurely abandon the platform, which is actually pretty good.But mostly I just loved the fact that I can tether it to my laptop to access the internet without paying extra smartphone tethering plan / jailbreak / etc.. (for some reason, some telco considered this phone a dumbphone - thus I can use the unlimited data plan for dumbphone. Which is cheaper. WIN!!)++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This is a good phone. But no gadget is perfect and I will go into the pros / cons. Hopefully this will help those who are on the fence to make up their mind.(Really, the Symbian / Nokia users need not much convincing and are already very aware of the phone; while the android / iOS fans will probably just stick with what they are comfortable with).First, I have been a Nokia / Symbian user for a long time. My wife has an iPhone; so I can appreciate both. Played a bit with android but did not spend too much time with it to give a fair opinion on it. On to the review:What about the Hardware?First, the hardware is very nice and is a major selling point. The OLED screen with 'Clear Black Display' really looks nice on the eye. If people are impressed with 'Retina Display' they should be equally impressed with E7 screen with the vivid color and unparalleled contrast. OLED also draws less power and have tricks with the sleeping screen (check Nokia Beta Labs - Sleeping Screen app).The form factor is another reason to consider E7. For those like me, who prefer a hardware keyboard... Let me say that the keyboard is one of the best. The slide mechanism is solid and impressive too.The GPS function can easily replace a dedicated unit out there. Especially since you can sideload map from all over the world free using the OVI Suite.USB on the Go, HDMI output, QuickOffice offer great flexibility in sharing / viewing / moving your files and media. The media / music player is an included standard feature as well.Do I need to mention that the E7 cover all the international variants of GSM / HSDPA frequency band? This means you can access 3G pretty much all around the world where they are available. (Most other phones cover all the GSM frequency variants but not HSDPA.)In a nutshell, the hardware is a solid five. Some may disagree on the camera though. Being a fixed focus with EDOF (Extended Depth of Field), you will not be able to take close up picture. This is a trade-off for the slimmer body. Still, the picture is usable (I suggest to change the color to vivid and use sharpest setting - the camera processing seems to produce a very subdued picture). You may want to check Nokia N8 if camera is more important to you than a hardware keyboard.What about the software?Symbian^3 is a major step up from the earlier version. Still, to really enjoy it, one has to actually go into it and learn the intricacies. So yes, it is not as intuitive (simple) as iOS. But some may actually prefer the flexibility that comes with this. Here is a couple of tips (things I always do when I get a fresh Symbian phone):- Give accompanying OVI suite a try (try the beta version.. it's faster). I mostly use it as an easy way to tether my laptop (yes sir, big reason why I love unlocked Nokia phone) but some of the other features are nice too.- Update all the firmware / apps.- Reorganize the icons into folder structure that make sense to you. It is a hassle the first time but will make a difference as to how you use the phone. (Option > Organize)- Play around with the setting. (Seriously..)- If you really have to have iOS style interface, you can customize multiple shortcut widgets on your 3 home screens. Frankly, I never see the need to do this.- The search widget is quite useful... but do go to the setting to exclude items that you don't want it to index.Here is a tip... touch and hold is like a mouse right click. It brings up context menu for many items in the phone.What about the apps?Sad to say, this is a major con when it comes to Symbian. If you come from Android / iOS, the first thing you will notice is actually the lack of it. This is especially a concern now since Nokia announcement to transition to Windows Mobile. It makes for less incentive for software developers to further develop apps for the platform.That said, thus far, I am still seeing new apps every now and then. And Symbian is feature rich enough that you don't necessarily miss them. Still, here are a couple apps you should get if you do get the phone.- Opera Mini / Mobile : Trust me, this will make your browsing experience much, much better. Nuff said. (also, please tinker with the setting.)- Swype : You don't really need it for this phone because of the hardware keyboard. But if you are lazy to flip it open.- Gravity : Facebook / Twitter client- JoikuSpot : turn your phone into mobile WiFi HotSpot.- Nokia Internet Radio / Tunewiki : Good for listening to Shoutcast radio.- Try out any of the apps from Nokia Beta Labs / Check out Ovi Store...- If you are adventurous, scour the net for various app out there in the net too (I typically go to allaboutsymbian.com for tips, etc)Frankly, there is not much essential apps to mention for now.. I do wish we have a kindle app for the phone (are you listening Amazon?). Maybe Evernote. And maybe more games too.

"Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)","Nokia","99.99","2","With one word: NO.After owning and E71 for over a year, which for me was by far the best phone that I have ever used, I was really excited about getting the new E72 since it featured a 600Mhz CPU which seemed to be my main and only issue with the E71. However the CPU was the only upgrade in this unit and almost everything else seemed to be in fact a downgrade. As mentioned by another reviewer this phone has serious stability issues. The FP2 OS is extremely buggy and crashes, reboots and freezes several times a day. Nokia really needs to work on a new firmware to correct this. Below is every quality of the phone that I could think of as compared to the E71.HARDWARE-----------------------------BUILD QUALITY: Definitely not as solid of a feeling compared to the mostly metal E71. The D-pad feels like cheap plastic and it has some free play. The back cover tends to move occasionally when you are holding the phone to your ear.SPEAKERPHONE: Very poor quality compared to the E71. There is very noticeable buzzing near the maximum volume, even with high quality music files. Calls on speakerphone at max volume are plain annoying due to the buzzing. On top of that the speaker is not as loud as the one on the E71.CALL QUALITY: Excellent call quality except at the maximum volume where the call speaker also becomes distorted.KEYBOARD AND TOUCHPAD: The keyboard feels slightly better than the one on the E71. The buttons seem to give out somewhat of a better feedback. However the E72 is slightly wider than the E71 which makes it a little harder to type on with one hand. The new track pad navigation provides a very inconsistent performance and it is not even close to the one on the newer blackberries. Scrolling up and down is perfectly fine but scrolling sideways becomes an exercise. The good news is that the original directional pad like on the E71 is still there so you can just disable the touchpad if you hate it just as much as I did after a week of usage.CAMERA: It is still a cell phone camera so keep your expectations low. It takes decent pictures and the quality is about the same as the E71 but with 5 megapixel images and slightly wider lens. The camera application now has built-in panorama mode. Video at 640x480 is plain horrible. The flash on this phone is actually pretty decent. One thing that was very annoying to me is that it uses a very bright focus light(AKA The flash) which makes focusing at macro impossible if you are trying to take a picture of something with brighter colors that reflect more light. There is no way to disable the focus light either, not even in macro mode. Nokia should think about this as well.BATTERY LIFE: There is simply nothing like it. Except the E71. The battery life on the E72 is also exceptional. I am able to get 2 to 3 days of very heavy usage on it, including 2 to 3 hours of talking, 2 hours of browsing and some text messaging. I have not seen any other phone in this category which gets even close to these stats.GPS: Works great and it gets a position fix generally within 5 seconds. It seems a little faster than the E71. The E72 also has a compass.SOFTWARE-------------------------This is the bad part.FP2: Aside from unifying various internet connections I really did not see much if any of an improvement in this version of the Symbian OS. In fact it features some ugly menu transitions and it has a lot of stability issues. You would get out of memory error with a subsequent freezing at least a couple of times in a day and reboots and total freezes which require battery removal are not uncommon either.APPLICATION UNLOCK: Yes, the phone is hackable with HelloOX 2 and up.WEB BROWSER: The browser is definitely improved from the E71 afar as rendering and navigation goes. However I was never able to complete even ONE single browsing session without this thing crashing and just exiting in the middle of something. It would have been great if it did not crash.E-MAIL: About as bad as the client available on my first T-Mobile Pocket PC with Windows Mobile 2002. Although that one was a little better than what Nokia has provided. It is almost 2010 and Nokia still does not have an e-mail client which supports in-line HTML. The Nokia messaging software and service is plain horrible. After 3 days of usage I just cancelled my account and went to using webmail. It is really that bad and this is unacceptable for a supposed ""business"" device. As an alternative, I would recommend Emoze. Their software even partially supports in-line HTML. If you have Hotmail, you can download Windows Live for Symbian. It works really well.PODCASTING & INTERNET RADIO: Missing!!!???! Very disappointing.SIP CLIENT: Missing!!! The SIP settings are there, but there is no client. So forget about gizmo or any similar service unless you are using a third party client like Nimbuzz or Fring.OFFICE APPLICATIONS: This is one positive category. Quickoffice features a free upgrade to open and edit Office 2007 documents. Nokia has also added Wpresenter, Multiscanner and Font Magnifier as standard applications.--------------------Overall the E72 is a mixed bag for me. It delivers on speed and the browser is well improved but the stability issues, missing software and some other quirks make this device seem like a downgrade. If I was aware of these issues it is likely that I would have stayed with the E71. So if you are in doubt, my advice would be save your money or at least wait for a firmware update which fixes the stability issues. I hope this was helpful.","146","helpful"

"Nokia C2-01.5 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Music and Video Player--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)","Nokia","98","5","The Amazon price was the best available at the time of my purchase. Combine that with free shipping and this is a really great deal for those who want a GSM phone that has a decent camera, is simple to use, and has a reasonably small form factor. I am using mine on the AT&T network currently. I was previously using a Sony Ericsson W518a, which had been giving me a multitude of problems. I wanted a simple, unlocked phone that would work with my voice and text plan, but I didn't want to go backwards in camera resolution or expandable memory capabilities. Additionally, I did not want to renew my contract with an upgrade from AT&T (Just in case I want to switch carriers in the near future). I don't have a data plan and pretty much only talk and text from my device. This phone does both very well. The reception and voice clarity are superior to that of my previous Sony Ericsson. The Nokia interface is not as aesthetically refined as the Sony Ericsson was, but it is simple and reliable. I will take functionality over beauty if I have to choose between the two. Some nice extras are the inclusion of a 3.5 mm audio jack and a micro USB port which can be used for charging and data transfers (I hate proprietary jacks!). The only problems I had were in configuring the MMS, Internet, and MEdia Net settings. Since this phone has never been sold by AT&T, they won't provide any technical support. However, once I found some instructions for the configuration, it was easy to get all features running smoothly. This was a great buy.

"Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Red","Nokia","149.35","5","The 5 stars rating is as much for the seller (Mega Mobile) as it is for the phone. The phone is a true RM-821 (international unlocked). It looks like it came from HK. Everything is in Chinese (even the documentation). Took me only a couple of minutes to remove the Chinese setting, and replace it with English, and another language. It seems that the phone supports just about any language, and it's really easy to change language setting. (for some language, it requires a download, but with wi-fi it's not an issue).What can I say, the phone is incredible, very responsive, has Nokia Drive, Office, a great camera,... ( the list is too long to write here).The phone is great. but trying to buy the phone was a very frustrating experience. Amazon has a page with one phone specification, and several sellers. Unfortunately some sellers try to sell you an AT&T unlocked for an international version. I found that it's very important for reviewers to start the review with the seller, what was ordered, and what was received. This will tremendously help people who want to buy the international version.I had contact with 4 sellers:1. Hollywood Merchandise (fulfill by Amazon); sold me an AT&T unlocked RM-820(it was advertised as international, factory unlocked). Returned the phone. Thank to Amazon, the process was painless got my money back right away.2. Mega Mobile; sold me this phone, and it is as advertised (international, factory unlocked, RM-821)In between I was in contact with:1. Tablets Distributors; As per their e-mail to me they sell AT&T unlocked phones.2. Global Mobiles; As per their e-mail to me they sell international unlocked phones (RM-821) that come from Europe.Their answer came after I ordered from Mega Mobiles.I hope this helps, the potential buyers who like me want a Nokia Lumia 920 international factory unlocked, but are at a loss as to what seller to buy it from.Update 6/13/13: The phone seems to have the latest updates; OS 8.0.10211.204, firmware: 1232.5957.1308.0004.One thing I forgot to mention about the seller, is that since the plug that was inside the Nokia box was incompatible with the U.S plug outlets. he added a U.S. adapter plug inside the box he sent me (nice touch).Update 11/21/13: Several week ago I installed the Amber update. Made a Great phone even better. Can't wait for the next 2 updates which will be available in the next few months.I liked the phone so much that I bought a second one for a family member. This time I bought the phone from 'The wireless circle'. The phone was as advertised (international version RM-821), and came several days ahead of schedule. This time the phone was from Czechoslovakia. Not a problem as it took only a couple of seconds to change to English (I had already downloaded the English manual for the phone), and actually better for me as it came with an European plug (it also have an US adapter in the box).Update 1/16/14: I would like to clarify few things for potential buyers:1. There are no factory unlocked Lumia phones built for the U.S market.2. Due to the above, buying a factory unlocked Lumia phone in the U.S. is buying from a grey market.3. There is no warranty on those phones, and they are not sealed.4. These phones come from all over the world, and will be in the language of the intended market. Plus it will have some built-in apps (put there by Nokia) that target the local market the phone was intended for. That doesn't mean that the phone was used.5. Setting the phone to your desired language, downloading the user's guide in your desired language and removing the local apps is a matter of minutes.6. The plug will be a plug for the intended market, but there will always be a U.S. adapter in the box. That might one the reason why the box is not sealed.I have bought 4 Lumias (2x 720 and 2x 920) from Amazon (received 6, returned 2 - one was defective, this other was AT&T unlocked).

There is no warranty on those phones, and they are not sealed.4. These phones come from all over the world, and will be in the language of the intended market.

"Nokia E63-2 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Ultramarine Blue)","Nokia","286","5","I purchased this phone (blue E63-2) three weeks ago. Overall, I am very happy with this phone. $200 for this unlocked smartphone is a great deal.I add my application background first in the following. Because I think a review will only be fair with certain application background. For example, for the email application, Blackberry is more powerful for the business user, it can have more functions or better performance when it is hooked up with your company exchange server. Also for data service performance in wireless network, I only use it in T-mobile network; I don't know how it performs in ATT's 3G network, so I don't comment on this.My service provider: T-mobileMy service package: voice + 100MB/month data serviceMy application: personal usePro:1. Full Q keyboard. Yes, a lot of smartphones have the full Q-keyboard. But the keyboard of E63 has the better design, the shape of each key enables you to type with less error-stroking.2. WI-FI: 802.11g compatible. The setup is very easy, it supports WEP/WPA/WPA2 wireless security features. And the link speed is very good. This enable me to go to internet and download applications at home (or hot-spot) without using the 100MB data-service bandwidth.3. When the ""bluetooth"" and the ""WLAN scanning"" are turned off, the battery life is GOOD; thanks to the physical size of the battery. When the ""WLAN scanning"" is off, you still can use the WLANs that have already been setup in the phone; it just won't search for the new WLAN. But for the ""bluetooth"", you will have to turn it on in order to use it; and the ""bluetooth"" seems draining more power than WIFI.4. Email service: I am using Nokia's free (for now) mail push service; it pushes my yahoo mails and the other mails to my E63, it notifies me when there is a new mail. Most time, it worked very quickly in T-mobile network (but my emails are more text oriented, HTML contents require additional download time). This is a great feature, I don't have to go to the internet to fetch the mails manually. One can download this email setup software from Nokia website. This is only available for BlackBerry and iPhone before, with a more expensive data service. (I don't know when Nokia will start to charge this service.)5. Completed PDA functions and reliable sync with PC (Syncing with PC by bluetooth is great!)6. Compare with the Nokia E71, I like this one better. The reasons are: lower-price and thicker body with plastic finishing. Although the body of E63 is plastic, but the texture feels very good and not easy to get the finger-prints. The thicker body has the acoustic advantage, the speaker performances well even when you are listening music. Of course, the lower price comes with the trade-offs: comparing with E71, the E63 does not have integrated GPS and the resolution of the camera is lower (3mp via 2mp)7. Music function: E63 has the 3.5 mm standard connector, which means you can use your favorite headset to listen to music. Although, the headset comes with the phone is stereo, and it has an in-line microphone; but the frequency response is not good enough to listen to music (if you are serious about listening). By using a standard headset, you still can make calls or receive calls, but you will have to speak to the microphone in the phone.Con:1. Image quality of camera. I can live with the 2MP resolution, but the noise of the camera is too obvious; even the pictures taken outdoor.2. Micro-USB cable is not included: This phone uses the Micro-USB interface, which is smaller than the mini-USB. I am sure most people have one or more mini-USB cables, which is widely used. But a lot of people don't have the micro-USB cable, at least I don't. So I have to go to a local shop to buy one ($15), and it is not easy to found one too. Very unfortunate, Nokia did not throw one in the box. Sometimes, it is very useful, such as when you want to copy a hundred songs to your phone's memory card; bluetooth is simply too slow to do this task.Update:Here is the update after three month use.(A) Don't put this phone into a case that is too tight; especially: preventing the keyboard to be touched when it is in the case. I found out if the keyboard is being touched, the phone will not go into the sleep mode and the battery runs out really fast.(B) The IP phone function(aka Internet phone) is great for the international long distant call (you must sign-up the ""Gizemo"" first), you can use it whenever you have the WIFI access; it cost much less than your wireless service provider's international plan. But after you finish a call, you should disconnect the phone from the WIFI completely; otherwise the battery goes down real quick. The reason is: as soon as you connect the IP phone service, it will contact the WIFI access point (such as your wireless router) periodically even when you are not making calls, this activity will use a lot of power.(C) The ""Remote lock"" is a great feature, and it is very easy to setup. First, you need to setup the ""lock code"" of this phone (after setup, write it down). Then enable the ""Allow Remote lock"" feature, it will ask a lock code again; it can be the same code in the FIRST step or a different one. If you lost your phone or simply forget your phone in the office; just grab another phone and send a text message to your phone, the message is the lock code. The message must contain the exactly same lock code, case must be matched and no extra space. Use another phone to send a text message is the best way to do it; some computer programs can send a text message to a wireless phone, but it tends to add some extra text in the message automatically, this will fail to lock the phone.","193","helpful"
"Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 4 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)","Nokia","79","5","OK..to start, I gotta say that the FREE shipping from Amazon SUCKS. So, if you want good shipping, dont use the FREE shipping that Amazon offers. Why? Tracking is horrible, tracking history is completely inaccurate.(I used the nokia N82 before)IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BUY THE CELLPHONE, READ THIS REVIEW. I THINK IT WILL HELP A LOT. IT IS LONG, I KNOW.Moving on, the cellphone is good for the price. Come on, where will you get a 300$ cellphone that has all the functions that this one has? It is insane: 3.2 camera, touchscreen, more customizable than iphone, external memory, etc etc.Regarding the touchscreen...I think it is personal taste.. I never used the iphone, and I think that this touchscreen it is VERY responsive. AFTER buying this phone and getting used to it, I used a friend's Itouch and I gotta say that my nokia 5800 is the winner. But as I said, it is personal taste. Still, it is a very responsible touchscreen (no matter you say that it is a resistive touchscreen)..like, you got no excuse..it is responsive, and it is responsive. PERIOD.Good things about it:-Starting to have more apps...you just gotta know where to find, for FREE.-MACRO of the camera is awesome.-I got the GPS with turn by turn voice direction (trial), and it is a dream. I wont know when they take away my trial...however, with voice direction, this thing it is a real GPS.-The media button is pretty useful.-It is legit that it unlocks when you take it close to your face when you are talking.-Speakers are also awesome. Super loud. Sound quality when you plug in earpieces are also really nice.-I love the cable to plug it in to the tv. I convert videos, put it on my cellphone and lay on my bed, plug the cellphone into the tv and voila. It is REALLY nice.-About apps. Right now I have 42 but I only use maybe 8 of them lol.-The screen it is mega-clear. It is one of the best screens ive seen.The ""so-so"" of this phone:-Build quality. It is pretty well built, however the screen it is TOO plasticky. When I put it under the sun, the reflection shows a big difference in the surface, I mean..it is not completely flat. Using the reflection of light you will realize it is not completely flat. In other words, the screen presents big flex (like in laptops, for instance). However, the rest of the cellphone is well built. If you take out the screen part of the cellphone, it is a pretty solid cellphone.-The camera. I dont know. Sometime it takes great pictures, sometimes it stinks. When there is too much suns, it doesnt work well. When there isnt light, it also sucks. It has to have the right amount of light.-For some people it may be ok, but this is a freaken fingerprint magnet. only the back cover it is mate. The rest of the cellphone devours fingerprint as a dinasour.-Battery life it is not the best, but not the worst.The bad:-The interface it is not the friendliest. It could be better. I hope that with the update, it will be user friendlier.-The screen. As I said, it is too flexible. It kills me to see differences with the reflection of the light (you know what im saying if you have the cellphone). It makes me hella nervous.-Sometimes the phone in landscape mode, when you want to scroll down or up for example in some setting, it is freaking hard. I always keep tapping the wrong thing. in vertical mode this doesnt happen, because the scroll bar it is sticked to the right of the screen, so you dont have margin of error. however, in landscape mode the scroll bar is in the middle of the screen, so it gets tricky.-Honestly, the phone it isnt the best looking phone in the market. It is just a chunk of plastic. (This is for people that care about appearances. I personally dont care, but im trying to be objective)Ok, I think this is pretty much it. If you read this, you may decide whether to buy ir or not. I think it is a pretty good phone for the price. If you are RICH and money it is not your main problem, I would say go buy yourself a N97. Oppositely, I would say definitely go for this cellphone; I like it pretty much. You wont regret it (however, remember all the things I wrote in this review). If you are ok with the cons of this cellphone, you wont regret. And in my opinion, the Pro's overcome the Con's so... I dont know, it is your call!I hope this helped.","264","helpful"
"Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White","Samsung","222","5","I ordered an unlocked AT&T 4g LTE Samsung s5. It was Delivered on time. I was able to follow the tracking. Even though it came through USPS (UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE), the phone got to me in 2 days. No shipping charges nor sales tax, and I'm not a Prime Member either. The phone was in excellent condition, actually it was brand new in a tightly sealed package. The 3.0 charging/syncing cable was included. As well as the charger and ear phones, with extra ear buds to change out or replace lost ones. I have Straight Talk and took my sim card out of my HTC ONE VX and placed it in the s5. Installed the battery, Turned on phone, set up phone, and worked great. Battery was at full charge. Only issue, not having anything to do with the seller, I had to call Straight Talk and get the correct APN settings. I googled the APN settings and everything was correct except a couple of those APN settings. I wasn't able to connect to the internet, unless I had wifi. But after getting the correct APN settings from Straight Talk, I could connect to the internet without any issues. ***If you do have Straight Talk and you need help with the APN settings, it would be best if you called from a different phone. The reason why i say that is because they will not want to help you put in the correct settings. ***The phone has crystal clear videos. No drop calls. Able to hook up to bluetooth devices without any issues. Awesome graphics for games. Waiting for my 128gb sd card to come in to expand the memory. The S6 does not allow you to remove the battery nor add an micro SD card and that us another reason i chise thjs phone. Wife really likes the phone and she is considering getting one as well. I Watched the youtube video on the water test. The guy had the phone in 3 feet of water for an hour and never stopped working. I put my phone in a 5 gallon bucket of water for 15 minutes and nothing happened. Yeah it would have sucked if i messed it up by doing that, but i was confident nothing would happen. you want a phone that you will enjoy, purchase this phone. You want regret it. I first thought about the newest iPhone, but I'm glad I got the s5. I was just dissapointed that I didn't order it sooner.","6","helpful"

"Samsung Galaxy S4 I545 16GB Verizon Wireless + GSM Quad-Core Android Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera - White","Samsung","176.07","1","*** UPDATED TO 1 STAR FOR LACK OF WARRANTY SUPPORT ***The display on this phone died yesterday completely out of the blue as it sat on a desk. Having purchased it new just 7 months ago, I wasn't pressed as it should be under warranty, from Samsung's Warranty Declaration:""STANDARD LIMITED WARRANTY What is covered and for how long? The warranty period commences upon the date of purchase by the first consumer purchaser and continuing for the following specified period of time after that date: Device 1 YearBattery(ies)* 1 YearOther Accessories* 1 Year""Great, I can tick all those boxes. But after going through the repair request process, I was getting charged anyway. I contacted support directly, and was told by rep Janet my phone was out of warranty ""on their end"". To make things worse, you can't reply, but have to start from the beginning and make a brand new support request for another random rep. And none of their survey or feedback links work.Typical of so many companies. Great product, worthless support. A phone that costs hundreds of dollars should last more than a year - and if not, it should be fixed, period.Original Review:There are many incredibly in-depth reviews for this phone as it has been around awhile. I couldn't see any reason to pay more money to get the newer version - this one has everything I wanted in a phone. The only knock I would give it is battery life. Coming from the Motorola line of 'Maxx' phones (which last for a minimum of 2 days on a charge), it was a bit of a transition. But generally, it does get through a day of my typical use. (just barely).Newer Samsung devices are Qi wireless charging compatible. This one is not - BUT you can easily add it with one of these:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HR10NZW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The S4 has the contacts (just above the battery compartment). This means installation takes no more then popping off the battery cover, slipping in the Qi adapter and aligning it with the charge contacts, and replacing the cover. 10 seconds, done. Now you have wireless charging!I can only knock this phone for two things, the battery life (though it does charge VERY quickly), and of course all the bloatware that comes installed. Thankfully you can remove or turn off all this easily - which will also help your battery life.","9","helpful"

"Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-i9195i Unlocked Cellphone, Retail Packaging, White Frost","Samsung","276.37","5","WOW. This phone actually fits in your hand! Although it has a 4.3"" screen, it is narrower than the original Galaxy S1 (Captivate, Vibrant, etc.) as well as the Galaxy S3 mini. What else? Great specs! This is a really fast and powerful phone, WITH an MicroSD card slot. While not as fast as the full-sized S4, it is faster than the S3, and many other phones on the market. That, along with TouchWiz UI, plus the option to install CyanogenMod (Stock Android ROM), and you have a really nice phone. The only cons are the screen resolution and the bundled software. The screen is not HD, but really, it's fine. 16:9 videos look great and fit edge-to-edge. As far as software, the phone comes preloaded with a lot of garbage that cannot be removed without rooting, but it still runs fast, and the apps can be hidden from the app drawer. The phone also has NFC, eye tracking, and plenty of other gimmicks... and the price is right, so what's there not to like?","9","helpful"

There's no way you can be mislead about this device. I've owned it for a few months now and I'm still really surprised at the negative feedback. ""It's bulky"" boasts the note3 enthusiasts. What a joke. This is really the best device I've bought in years. It's straight forward and that's what I like about it. The size and weight make it much easier to use than most phones I see today.

"Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom 16MP Camera Android Smartphone - White (International Version)","Samsung","325","5","The Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom smartphone has gotten somewhat mixed reviews both on this site and in other media (where reviews have been more critical).It is an Android phone with a 10x zoom camera. So compromises were made on each side. But the compromises were sound in my opinion.I've had it a day. I've put it through the paces.As an (I guess I must admit) ""aging"" technology fan I am able make a broader comparison of this device.Compared to my first mobile phone from 1996 which was a brick that cost a fortune this device is a relative peanut -- and a power-packed peanut, at that.To make another comparison, the form factor of this device is about the same as the Palm Treo I had about 10 years ago. I was never really able to get the Treo to work well.This device I was able to get in full operation (using a micro SIM and StraightTalk service) in about an hour. Then I spent another hour (or two or three) marveling at all of its features/functions and the really superb quality/capability of the camera.It is a very good smartphone with Android OS -- fully functional. Easy to use. Fast in operation. It is to my observation no slower than my Samsung GT-N5100 Note -- which is very fast. Compared to the Samsung SCH-738C that it replaced it is a racer.I'm a guy who was carrying a phone and a camera around. So I'm glad to have the option of the two devices combined into one device. I was sick and tired of taking bad smartphone photos and/or trying to find the best Android camera app (which I really never did find).The camera is -- well, it is a good point-and-shoot camera. It takes better quality pictures than any smartphone I've used; it takes pictures that are as good as any of the mid-range point-and-shoot cameras that I own (but now have the option of not having to carry around with me).Summing up the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom: It is chunky (again, think Palm Treo). But it is a smartphone and camera -- powerful and fun.The battery life will need to be managed attentively; but you can charge this device like any mobile phone (I keep a charger in the car and in just about every room where the device goes).It will need a suitable case -- I'm looking for that item.

So think twice about how you will carry it around with you.I have been poking about with this phone since I got it yesterday, and it has so many things to learn that I will take a long time before I figure out all of it. From what I have seen, there is a lot customization allowed along with a lot of pre-loaded apps. Example: The memo app is very nice for it to allow stylus writing, text writing, attachment insertion, voice writing/recording, ability to share it, etc...The connectivity of the phone is also very strong. It seems a bit slow with hotmail for some reason, but everything else runs fast involving the net (4G / Wifi home speed).The camera captures great detail. Dual camera is a nice option. I have yet to test it for video calls.It has a fast-charging, removable battery. The charge seems to last quite a while (I keep power saving features on such as screen turning off after a minute.). There are many options to optimize your battery life when it is idle or to make sure your phone functions are not disabled if you want them to remain connected.The phone allows for expandable storage which is essential, in my opinion. There seems to be an option to transfer apps from the phone to the microSD card as well.The product for the price is great. If you have time, the Galaxy Note 2 might drop a bit more in price. But at the current time, it just costs too much when the Galaxy Note 1 (this product) is a nice thing for everyone to have. Tablet + Phone = Excellent idea.","16","helpful"

"Samsung Galaxy S6 G920FD Dual-SIM 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Octa-Core Smartphone - Black Sapphire","Samsung","449.95","5","I purchased this phone to replace my Google Nexus 4. Though I was happy with the Nexus phone, after nearly 3 years the battery appeared to be deteriorating. Google's new phone offering is much larger and I didn't want what amounts to a Phablet. The Samsung Galaxy S6 is only slightly longer and very thin and light. The camera is superior to my old Nexus. Apps are simple and easy to locate and adjust. So far, the battery life is quite good, but I'm usually using only basic text, phone and minimal data programs.My biggest concern was whether an ""international"" dual sim card phone would be compatible with my existing StraightTalk prepaid plan in Illinois. I ordered my new NANO SIM card and got the phone up an running without a problem. Originally, I struggled with getting the phone to receive data, which is included in my carrier plan. After an unsuccessful call to StraightTalk tech support, I realized the problem wasn't due to inaccurate APN settings, but because I had not selected the installed SIM card in the settings/SIM card manager option.The dual SIM card feature in this phone is pretty cool. You can easily purchase a prepaid international SIM card if needed, and use the phone abroad. Then you have the option of toggling back and forth between SIM cards whenever necessary.","16","helpful"

I have Consumer Cellular that runs off of At&T and T.mobile network. No problem with the set up, I just inserted the sim card. I needed a Camera upgrade. I've had a Blu and also several Ule phns. non of the camera's compare's to this one. Pics are Clr and great sounding music. I did have a problem with my pics downloading to the gallery, but after I reset it to the factory mode that took care of that issue..I read a comment about emoji keyboard not working. I had this issue also but I uninstalled chompSms and installed smsPro.(it works fine) I don't care for all the ads that comes with it. I just x them out and keep on typing.. The regular message app that came with the phne doesn't have a fun keyboard, and this is very strange with a Phne that was made in the USA??..I don't like that, because I text a lot and I would like to have access to another texting app(Ad Free) One other thing, there are not a lot of apps installed like I had on the Ule phne. Not sure about the app that is installed called ""hangout"" but I did notice it has a lot of Great emojis, realy fun ones. ..Why couldn't the developer just add that to the regular message app thatis on the phone?????? or at least add some emoji's?? Does anyone know if that Hangout is safe to text from? This is a real user friendly Phne.. thecamera is Great.....The music is really nice, This Phne has really good apps installed.. Lovin this Phne more and more each day!!! there is nothing slow about this Phne......only one regret, I didn't order the 6.0..","6","helpful"

To me that's just ridiculous to spend so much money on a phone, I could find a million better things to do with that kind of money but hey, to each its own. I finally ran across this sky device, what caught my eye first was the size and the 13mp camera, so I read into it and I was pretty impressed with the reviews I read, so I decided to give it a go and purchased this phone. I must say honest, honest,honestly this phone is awesome!!!! I absolutely love it, its big, gorgeous, sturdy, fast and the camera is amazing front and back. Also great video quality. I am coming from a galaxy s3 which is still more pricey than this phone even today and this phone is BETTER. The sky 5.5q is a great phone, I was so nervous about buying it and now I'm so happy I just want to help someone who's struggling with decision making on phones. It takes micro Sim, and it also comes with a one year factory warranty.

"SKY Devices 5.5Q - White (Discontinued)","SKY Devices","149.9","5","I did a lot of research before I purchased my phone.I was really thinking about buying a phone from the company called BLU but as I researched for a couple of days and spoke to people on YouTube it wasn't a long lasting phone and the camera and memory was bad and after a month their phones would break down on them and the screen wouldn't move (heard this from about six different people) so then I decided that was a no go.So I kept looking on amazon and came across Sky phones. I spent about four days researching on this company and from their customers on YouTube.The people who I spoke to said that this phone has a great camera, works fast,and it will last me a long time.There was this guy that said he had his Sky 5.5 for about 7 months and that it still works as if its new.So I decided to order one off of Amazon. I love this phone, I purchased a 32g memory card and I have so many apps running and am always on it.I love that I can customise my text background just like I did with my Samsung. The screen has great picture, the speakers are loud,the front and back camera have really good quality. This phone came with a screen saver,headphones,a phone cover,and a charger.The only bad thing is that it doesn't have emojis.But other than that this phone is amazing.I cannot take it out of my hands.The HD pictures have me hooked.Good buy for such a cheap price.Definitely sticking to Sky products.Problem you will encounter:Only navigation it will work on is Google maps which is already installed on the phone. Its the only navigation that works while I'm playing musicP.S it does work for metro,all I had to do was call customer service and give them the sim card number and the IMEI number (whatever it's called)","31","helpful"

Performs as described so compared to more expensive BRAND named phones that do the same thing, this is the phone to buy. Several things must be considered though before purchasing. There are TWO types of technology involving ALL cell phones. There is GSM and CDMA. which are NOT interchangeable. AT&T and T-Mobile use GSM however Sprint and Verizon use CDMA. So this phone can only be used with the GSM technology so can be used with a AT&T or T-Mobile etc. but NOT Sprint & Verizon. So you have to insure the carrier your going to use fits this phone. Now many people were complaining about having to buy multiple phones when changing carriers and not being able to use their phones for different carriers so wanted them to be able to be unlocked. Cell companies were not to happy with that and ended up caving in to the demand. HOWEVER each company has it's requirements to unlocking their phones so make sure you ASK. ALSO.... Remember that the only technolgy that will work for your phone regardless of locked or unlocked is whether or not is a GSM or CDMA. NOW, relating to SIM Cards. Since the companies caved to unlocking their phones, they now have put their SAFEGUARD in their phones. So here's how that works. You buy a phone say from AT&T (GSM) and decide later to drop AT&T and switch over to T-Mobile, also (GSM) When you install the SIM Card from T-Mobile, YES it will work because it's a GSM, BUT the phone recognises that it's NOT an AT&T phone so some things, coincidentally??? might not won't or work as well on the phone like they did with AT&T because the PHONE knows that it's not a SIM Card from AT&T. So the phone knows what SIM Card it has in it. Now if you buy an unlocked phone like this, generic, yes it can be used with any carrier using the GSM technology. BUT when you put the SIM card in from the carrier you choose say in this case T-Mobile or AT&T, the COMPANY knows your not using one of THEIR phones purchased from THEM!!! Well they're not to thrilled with that. They want you to buy THEIR phones and keep THEIR service. So although your using a GSM Phone and it's through a GSM carrier, again some things might not work as well or the reception might not be as good as it would be if you purchased one of THEIR phones with THEIR SIM card. So yes you can use this phone with any of the companies it claims, BUT that doesn't mean you'll get the SAME quality throguh it as you would through one of THEIR phones. NOW, if your going to be using it with quite a bit of usage being involved with the internet, then your pretty limited to choices. DATA usage is a MAJOR factor when considering cell phone and carrier preference. I had a Virgin Mobile phone partnered through Sprint. Best coverage for where we live at. Well this phone WON'T work with Sprint because Sprint uses CDMA. I tried T-Mobile. That right now, depending on needs/usage is the best plan. BUT you need to have TWO lines for $100.00 Unlimited Talk and Data with a GREAT European Plan included. But it's two lines or none. You go ONE line and you pay much more. ALSO, yes they have a PRE-Pay BUT if you get the PRE-Pay plan you do NOT get FULL usage of their towers. I purchased this phone for myself and decided because of it's low cost and all it's options to buy one for my wife. We then bought the TWO line plan through T-Moble. When we found out it was unable to get reception where we live, not SPRINT (CDMA) we decided to return it. So now I have to find a carrier which more than likely will be either AT&T or SPRINT which with just ONE plan will probably cost me out the butt and that I'll NOT be able to get reception wher I live at, but nothing I can do. Now the phone DOES everything it claims it does PRO.... BUT, a CON is that for some reason or another the phone keeps dropping recognition of my SD Card. Says it was removed and to reinstall even though I didn't take it out. Hope this info helped and GOOD Luck! :-)","57","helpful"

So this phone can only be used with the GSM technology so can be used with a AT&T or T-Mobile etc. but NOT Sprint & Verizon. So you have to insure the carrier your going to use fits this phone. Now many people were complaining about having to buy multiple phones when changing carriers and not being able to use their phones for different carriers so wanted them to be able to be unlocked. Cell companies were not to happy with that and ended up caving in to the demand. HOWEVER each company has it's requirements to unlocking their phones so make sure you ASK. ALSO.... Remember that the only technolgy that will work for your phone regardless of locked or unlocked is whether or not is a GSM or CDMA. NOW, relating to SIM Cards. Since the companies caved to unlocking their phones, they now have put their SAFEGUARD in their phones. So here's how that works. You buy a phone say from AT&T (GSM) and decide later to drop AT&T and switch over to T-Mobile, also (GSM) When you install the SIM Card from T-Mobile, YES it will work because it's a GSM, BUT the phone recognises that it's NOT an AT&T phone so some things, coincidentally??? might not won't or work as well on the phone like they did with AT&T because the PHONE knows that it's not a SIM Card from AT&T. So the phone knows what SIM Card it has in it. Now if you buy an unlocked phone like this, generic, yes it can be used with any carrier using the GSM technology. BUT when you put the SIM card in from the carrier you choose say in this case T-Mobile or AT&T, the COMPANY knows your not using one of THEIR phones purchased from THEM!!! Well they're not to thrilled with that. They want you to buy THEIR phones and keep THEIR service. So although your using a GSM Phone and it's through a GSM carrier, again some things might not work as well or the reception might not be as good as it would be if you purchased one of THEIR phones with THEIR SIM card. So yes you can use this phone with any of the companies it claims, BUT that doesn't mean you'll get the SAME quality throguh it as you would through one of THEIR phones. NOW, if your going to be using it with quite a bit of usage being involved with the internet, then your pretty limited to choices. DATA usage is a MAJOR factor when considering cell phone and carrier preference. I had a Virgin Mobile phone partnered through Sprint. Best coverage for where we live at. Well this phone WON'T work with Sprint because Sprint uses CDMA. I tried T-Mobile. That right now, depending on needs/usage is the best plan. BUT you need to have TWO lines for $100.00 Unlimited Talk and Data with a GREAT European Plan included. But it's two lines or none. You go ONE line and you pay much more. ALSO, yes they have a PRE-Pay BUT if you get the PRE-Pay plan you do NOT get FULL usage of their towers. I purchased this phone for myself and decided because of it's low cost and all it's options to buy one for my wife. We then bought the TWO line plan through T-Moble. When we found out it was unable to get reception where we live, not SPRINT (CDMA) we decided to return it. So now I have to find a carrier which more than likely will be either AT&T or SPRINT which with just ONE plan will probably cost me out the butt and that I'll NOT be able to get reception wher I live at, but nothing I can do. Now the phone DOES everything it claims it does PRO.... BUT, a CON is that for some reason or another the phone keeps dropping recognition of my SD Card. Says it was removed and to reinstall even though I didn't take it out. Hope this info helped and GOOD Luck! :-)","57","helpful"

"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)","Sony","269.1","1","UPDATE: (Changed review from 1-star to 3-stars) After shipping the phone to the Nokia Service Center for repairs (sent on a Friday received back by the following Wednesday), the phone is working fine. There are still a few, small glitchy software issues - but otherwise functioning properly. I am not sure if it was this individual phone or if all N97s have software issues to start. However, now I am afraid to update the phone software, for fear that it will have more problems. One note: it was difficult to get in touch with support and speak to someone ""live."" I sent the phone in on blind trust without speaking to anyone - but all's well that ends well..._____________________________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have had this phone since July 3, 2009. Since purchase I have had to deal with one issue after another, all related to the software and application interface. The hardware (physical) phone itself was great.Negatives:Too numerous to list all of them here, but essentially the software and applications are not intuitive and have MAJOR issues. I am fairly tech savvy and I cannot even imagine how someone who is less knowledgeable in this area would be able to deal with this phone. Very high maintenance.--It took me, and several tech geek friends, A LOT of time to figure out how to set up 2 email accounts.--The wireless access would not ""remember"" my wireless WEP key and typing that long# in repeatedly is not fun! It started 'saving' it on its own one day. (see reboot story below - now it doesn't save any more)--Facebook app and ""Favorites"" app won't load onto the home screen (just says ""Loading"" but never does). I tried to reinstall the Facebook app, but had to go to a 3rd party site to find it. Nokia's Ovi store no longer has a FB app available. Once an app is gone from your phone - good luck trying to reinstall it. Impossible. If you can even find the app anywhere.--Apps randomly work, then don't work. Very mysterious.Yesterday I had to do a hard reset back to the factory settings (which means I had to back up and then delete all of my data, photos, text messages, music, and loose all of my settings, including difficult-to-set-up email connection settings, etc), to try and get the non-working/disappeared apps to work. There wasn't much else I could do the software was so messed up. It was the last resort to get the phone to function properly. However, resetting it essentially ""killed"" the phone interface entirely. It is so bad that I just sent my phone to Nokia's repair site in Alabama (their ""customer care"" phone and email are essentially non-existant: phone tree loop and a ""generic"" email response is what they consider ""care."") Now, I am waiting to see if/when they fix the phone. Here is how the phone was ""working"" after the hard reset (that was supposed to bring it back to the original factory settings):--The key pad won't function (on screen) so I can't even try another hard reset.--The phone doesn't work (can't access it).--The camera won't function.--Most of the apps are missing. Including facebook and 'favorites'.--Most of the apps that are still on the phone won't function.--The phone shuts off when connected to the computer to update software.--The phone randomly shuts on and off when you try to access an app.--The 'memory full' message keeps appearing when there is nothing on the phone and there are no apps open.Among other issues...My main concerns about having to mail my new, $700 phone to a far away repair place are:(1) now I am stuck with NO PHONE for ""7-10+ days"" and I am trying to run a small business (ironically enough it is for usability testing of products such as this - and boy does Nokia need to test their N97 interface - have they actually read the Nokia Users Discussion board?), and;(2) the ""Repair form"" instructions for returning the phone state that they will ""call me with an estimate of the cost(shouldn't it be free?!)"" or that they will ""return the phone if it is not repairable."" That's just great. Can you tell that I am really annoyed? The phone cost $700!!!Positives:Nice hardware. The keyboard is easy to use and read. I liked the matte feel of the keys. The screen is large and crisp in terms of readbility, and I love the fact that you can use your finger or a stylus (or finger nail - which you can't do on the iPhone) to activate the touch screen. I love the weight and solid feel of the phone. The silver buttons and edging is also a nice touch. The camera, when it worked, took nice photos that rivaled my digital cameras' pics.The white phone is pretty cool looking - too bad it doesn't work!","6","helpful"

"Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini ST15i Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone--International Version with No US Warranty (Black)","Sony","399.92","1","I didn't do much research before buying this phone and now I'm paying for it. After buying this phone, I found out that the phone has a manufacturing defect that can't be fixed. The phone gets hot after minor use, which automatically activates its capacitive touch buttons. This in turn leads to the ""menu and screen dance,"" where different menus and screens keep popping up automatically. Check out the attached video to see this problem in action. You can find thousands of people on internet who are facing the same issue. The phone is useless and the seller has washed his hands off by not providing any US warranty. If I talk to Sony customer service, they tell me that this is not a US phone and so they can't do anything about it. Why is the seller selling a defective product in the first place? Donate your money or do something better with it rather than wasting it this way.","6","helpful"

It was alright at first, but it went down hill fast and hard!! I had to delete 90% of my apps b/c my phone keeps running out of memory. I take pictures on a rare occasion if I need to document something for work. Other than that, it just keeps somehow running out of room. I don't update it anymore b/c that takes up memory. It freezes up a few times a week. Sometimes It freezes WHEN MY ALARM IS GOING OFF!! So I have to take off my phone case and remove the battery. Very infuriating when you're just waking up. There's a lot of lag on the phone. Yes this phone may be cheap, but trust me when I say save your money. Buy a cheap, non-smart, nokia phone and save up your money for an actual good smart phone. As for this phone, BEWARE and STAY AWAY. If you do buy it, a few months later don't say I didn't warn you. . .Previous Review: February 26, 2014:The phone works (I'm stationed in Italy). I'm able to put a european sim card in it with no problem. It's not the best phone out there, but it works as a good smart phone. I only have a short time left on my tour and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on great smart phone (ie. galaxy S5 or Note 3), so I wanted to get a budget smart phone for internet usage.pros:-responsive touch screen-decent speed-SD card slot available for extra memory-great speakers-has most features you find on any smart phone-checking fb, email, bank accounts, etc runs smooth.cons:-low quality camera with no focus-decent speed-not a lot of internal memory-reception is ehh inside certain facilitiesAll in all, it's a great smartphone for someone on a budget.

T-Mobile claims it is not compatible with their network - possible since it does not have the 1700 mhz band supposedly - yet I had been getting 3g for two days - all of a sudden - only edge. Oh well. If they are going to play games with teh bands on the phones I will continue to avoid their overpriced in store phones and will have to seek out a 1700 mhz phone until my contract is up with them.Wow. So far i really like this phone. Old phone was a Samsung galaxy S. It was getting old and had no internal memory - and as you know, not all apps can be moved to the SD card so I was constantly getting the ""low memory issues. This one seems to have enough internal to handle whatever cannot be moved to SD (time will tell.) But I really like the feel of this phone. Feels sturdy in the hand. A bit smaller than the Galaxy but has a more solid feel to it. In portrait that smaller size does make for typing issues but I find the microphone very accurate and use it most of the time to type. Battery life so far seems very good as well. I leave the Bluetooth on all the time and used WIFI on and off throughout the day and it doesn't seem to drain. (I tend to keep my phone plugged in anyway so it wouldn't be an issue at home.

"Sony Xperia Miro ST23A Unlocked Android Phone with 5 MP Camera and 3.5-Inch Screen--U.S. Warranty (White)","Sony","120","4","Update: T-Mobile sucks!Returning this phone. T-Mobile claims it is not compatible with their network - possible since it does not have the 1700 mhz band supposedly - yet I had been getting 3g for two days - all of a sudden - only edge. Oh well. If they are going to play games with teh bands on the phones I will continue to avoid their overpriced in store phones and will have to seek out a 1700 mhz phone until my contract is up with them.Wow. So far i really like this phone. Old phone was a Samsung galaxy S. It was getting old and had no internal memory - and as you know, not all apps can be moved to the SD card so I was constantly getting the ""low memory issues. This one seems to have enough internal to handle whatever cannot be moved to SD (time will tell.) But I really like the feel of this phone. Feels sturdy in the hand. A bit smaller than the Galaxy but has a more solid feel to it. In portrait that smaller size does make for typing issues but I find the microphone very accurate and use it most of the time to type. Battery life so far seems very good as well. I leave the Bluetooth on all the time and used WIFI on and off throughout the day and it doesn't seem to drain. (I tend to keep my phone plugged in anyway so it wouldn't be an issue at home. Also, it has a removable battery - for me this is a HUGE advantage as I can buy a spare for traveling or really long days and just swap out the battery.I have used SPB Shell on the Galaxy but it slowed it down too much.

"Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)","Sony","499.99","4","I purchased this phone about two weeks ago. This is my first android phone after switching from an iPhone 6. I've been pleasantly surprised by the phone so far. The andorid version on it seems decent and it works pretty well. The battery life is similar to my iPhone 6, with slightly better life when making phone calls and worse when doing a lot of data heavy tasks in facebook, twitter, google plus, email programs and browsing. It makes it easily through a day for me.Most of my issues so far have not been with the phone itself, but rather other services I want to use.For example, I haven't had any luck getting the AT&T visual voicemail app working with this phone. This was one of the few killer iOS features i miss and I feel like it should be built into android rather than apps for each phone company that suck and have a whitelist. This isn't sony's fault aside from their lack of a deal with any major carier in the US.The second issue is a lack of decent cases for the phone. Most of the ones on amazon so far have been cheap, soft cases that don't really hold up well. The screen protectors work as I had a drop the other day and it did take a chunk out of the protector but the phone is fine. I think I'm spoiled from owning an iphone for so many years, but a decent leather case would be much appreciated. Sony should offer some kind of case for it at least or make a deal for them.Finally, the text messaging app that is default with the phone isn't very good. This is easy to fix on android, but then I wasn't sure what to use. Many apps support it and I didn't see a feature matrix to know what to use. In this case, I think sony should consider a better default messaging app.The camera on the phone is decent, but I had hoped for a bit more. It's not as good in darker rooms as my iPhone was. It's also very bad when there is a lot of motion. For the price difference, this isn't a deal breaker for me but if you're really into photos this might not be the phone for you.A lot of people have asked me about the phone and commented on the appearance. Many people are impressed by the screen quality. I was as well. It's quite vivid.I do wish sony would fix their policy about not offering fingerprint scanning in the US. I miss that from my iphone.Another small headache was that contact imports were a problem. AT&T offered a tool to migrate and it was great for photos but only could grab 75 contacts. I had around 300. I ended up doing an export from icloud and then importing using google's contacts website. Most instructions online assume that you have a GMAIL account associated with google. In my case, I have a non google email account and it required finding this contacts site to actually work. The google site also cleaned up some duplicates from the AT&T import which was nice. Sony also has an app which I didn't try for contacts. It may have worked better. I'd recommend people just go right for the google site approach, especially if they don't need pictures imported.The location services are a bit buggy. I have it set to unlock my phone if it is at my house and it doesn't work sometimes. I don't know if that is an android issue or the phone GPS. The iphone was smart enough to realize if i was near my wifi i was home. I wish this phone understood that.Lastly, I had some issues with email. The stock app can connect to regular IMAP accounts fine. It works good for that. I also had a work GMAIL account with a custom domain and an exchange email account for grad school email. I didn't even try to use gmail from that app so I can't comment on that. I setup google gmail app. However, on my old iphone i had all but work mail setup in apple mail. With this phone, if i try to use exchange it tries to lock down the phone and won't allow any other email accounts to be setup. If I use microsoft outlook app, it works fine. I think this is a combination of a domain setup fail and the app. It shouldn't require those strict limitations on the email app if outlook works! This means I have 3 different mail programs to check 4 accounts. Kind of annoying.","6","helpful"
"Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty)","Sony","499.99","4","I've only had it a few days, so if I can remember I'll return to update this review some weeks from now. Thus far, I'm loving this little thing.On the outside, this thing is a really sleek device. I dislike the fingerprint magnet nature of the surface but it's not that big a deal to me. Aside from that, it feels substantive and of good quality despite being made of plastic. The screen is fantastic; the size and resolution, the colors, the brightness. I love it having USB type C, even if it is still at USB 2.0 speeds. While also on the thicker size (9.5 mm if I recall correctly), it still feels diminutive and nice in the hand. The camera... I'm mixed about. I tried taking some seemingly easy auto photos and got somewhat bad results, whereas my Lumia 950 and Honor 8 produced some consistently great shots. Like the Lumia 950, I LOVE that this has a shutter button.On the inside, the Snapdragon 650 positively *sings* on this paired with 3 GB RAM. Everything is so quick, speedy, and nicely animated. Software seems to be just about stock Android 6.0 and it shows. Battery life so far has been great, but that largely depends on the radios and whatever signal strength you're getting on a given day (seems better than the 950 or Honor 8, truthfully).Of significant note since this is the US model: THE FINGERPRINT SENSOR IS STILL THERE, BUT DISABLED THROUGH SOFTWARE. I was able to get the UK version of the software onto this one and it actually works. Search for it; there should be a thread on XDA forums that explains it. There is a perceived drop in cell reception (going from 5 bars and LTE indicator in the US to 4 bars and simple 4G indicator in the UK). It's odd, just earlier I was browsing the internet with great speed on only 1 bar of 4G; this leads me to believe that 1.) 4G here can indicate LTE but just doesn't show it, and 2.) one bar of '4G' isn't actually all that bad. Again, this is with the UK software. Great experience so far! (:","6","helpful"

"Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (Red)","Sony","433.22","5","There are better reviews than I could do written elsewhere, just wanted to comment a little.I have it rooted and the bootloader unlocked, running PACMan ROM(CM10.1 based) perfectly fine.If you have decent headphones the output on this tends to be a little quiet.It comes with a screen protector pre-installed. (but it still scratches easy, I ended up buying another one and plopping it on top)Once again, it's red. When I ordered this I didn't realize until a couple days later when I was looking at the order that it was, in fact, red and not black as I thought.I wasn't attached to it being black so it still looks good.Battery will last about 5 hours of non-stop video watching, or 20+ hours(I haven't gone past that yet) if you're not really using your phone much for anything(like maybe 30-60 minutes of sporadic screen usage for messaging or something in the whole day at minimum brightness)I don't see what the big fuss about viewing angles is, it doesn't render it unreadable or anything... It's not even bothersome if I'm watching a video.T-Mobile just started rolling out LTE in Los Angeles so I've been picking that up around town, I'm able to reach speeds of almost 30/10 in some areas.Overall, coming from a Samsung Exhibit II 4G aka Galaxy Exhibit 4G, I'm fairly happy with this purchase.08/14/13 Update: Still going strong, running Illusion ROM now. Also wanted to comment that if you want to use this phone on T-Mobile it's as simple as ordering a mini-SIM card from them and putting it in.(Obviously you need service too) If you already have a T-Mobile SIM card then you can take it to any T-Mobile store and they will resize it for you, otherwise it costs about $20 to get a replacement SIM.11/13/13 Update: Everything's good in Sonyland, I'm now running Omni ROM which has great performance so far, I've combined it with Xposed Framework + Modules to get back the features that are missing from other ROMs, everything works great. Battery life is pretty decent so far, depends on how much I use the screen and whether I'm on mobile data or not. If I'm at home all day on Wifi and not using my phone much besides listening to some stuff now and then and some socializing, I'm at 46% after 14 hours.Now, in the real world, when I'm working and out and about, I tend to get about 8-10 hours before I hit the 20% mark, but personally I use my phone a lot when I'm working for various things, Wifi hotspot and Wifi analyzer are probably the most draining, along with using the screen more simply to look stuff up. Some people might fare better, but even still in an age where you can find an outlet anywhere, and car chargers are fairly cheap, I don't really see any reason to be worried about the battery, unless you plan on watching videos all day, in which case you can expect the same 5 hour battery life as the Galaxy S4.Myself, I carry a 12000mAH(claimed) backup battery when I need to charge while working around since I don't like leaving my phone to sit by an outlet(plus it looks a little janky), but the only times I've truly needed this are during a convention where there was poor mobile data reception and wifi was outrageously priced, thus forcing my phone to work probably twice as hard to maintain a decent connection, thus draining the battery faster than normal.Also, I have to exclaim about the build quality on this phone as it seems to be really quite solid, due to various mishaps my phone has fallen a couple of times onto concrete from probably 3-4 feet with just some minor cosmetic damage mostly on the bottom left corner, what was really surprising was the second time I dropped it, now keep in mind I have a Skinomi screen protector which has kind of a soft springy feel to it, the second time I dropped it the phone had landed flat on it's face, when I picked it up I was amazed to see not a single scratch of damage. My running theory is that the screen protector absorbed most of the shock, but even still, whatever Sony did with this phone seems to be alright.So far though, my biggest gripe is whatever amp they used on the phone is simply not powerful enough. For the earpiece it seems to be more than adequate, but I often find myself wishing to be able to raise the volume past maximum during a call on speakerphone, and the headphone out is just simply not powerful enough for most headphones.Now, after almost half a year, would I recommend this phone to people? Maybe. If you want more accessories or stronger developer support, the Nexus 5 is a fine choice along with the Galaxy S4 and LG G2. If you want a great phone that compliments class and is different compared to most people, I would strongly suggest the ZL. If you want a phone that's waterproof, you should probably be looking at the Xperia Z or Z1 not the ZL.In the end it comes down to preference, You have the Nexus 5 which is quite nice albeit lacking any sort of excitement and a microSD slot, the Galaxy S4 which is more expensive and everybody and their mothers have one(though the replaceable battery is quite nice), the LG G2 which is pretty much the Nexus 5 but with a bigger battery and with LG's software mods, then you have the Xperia Z1 which is just a second generation Z, and finally the HTC One which not only is similar in price to the S4 but it also lacks a microSD slot.And then the ZL itself, expensive yes, but not too expensive, different from the majority in design, yet similar in performance(for the most part), if anything, the ZL is a jack of all trades, master of none, managing to exceed at not exceeding, which sounds kind of dumb but if you have the phone it kind of makes sense, it's simply a good phone, nothing more, nothing less.Honestly the most surprising part of this phone is that the battery isn't removeable, considering the Xperia ZR, which is also waterproof mind you, does include this feature.Here's hoping to a new ZL for 2014 that can truly set a name for itself.04/28/14 Update: New builds of 4.4 ROMs for this phone have been pretty damn good at managing battery life, I usually expect my phone to last at least 8-12 hours during a normal workday, though I think my record so far is 35 hours, which was staying home for 2 days and using my phone only for some podcast listening.Performance feels smoother with newer ROMs, hoping to better battery and performance once the Sony official 4.4 ROM is out.I've gone through various screen protectors at this point, mostly to experiment, I still think Skinomi is the best at actually protecting your screen but it can sometimes make the screen look a little funny.A little bit of the paint on the back has scratched off but I think that's from the fall it took before, I just never noticed.Everything else on the phone is still in perfect, functioning order.","13","helpful"
"Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White)","Sony","248.98","5","There are better reviews than I could do written elsewhere, just wanted to comment a little.I have it rooted and the bootloader unlocked, running PACMan ROM(CM10.1 based) perfectly fine.If you have decent headphones the output on this tends to be a little quiet.It comes with a screen protector pre-installed. (but it still scratches easy, I ended up buying another one and plopping it on top)Once again, it's red. When I ordered this I didn't realize until a couple days later when I was looking at the order that it was, in fact, red and not black as I thought.I wasn't attached to it being black so it still looks good.Battery will last about 5 hours of non-stop video watching, or 20+ hours(I haven't gone past that yet) if you're not really using your phone much for anything(like maybe 30-60 minutes of sporadic screen usage for messaging or something in the whole day at minimum brightness)I don't see what the big fuss about viewing angles is, it doesn't render it unreadable or anything... It's not even bothersome if I'm watching a video.T-Mobile just started rolling out LTE in Los Angeles so I've been picking that up around town, I'm able to reach speeds of almost 30/10 in some areas.Overall, coming from a Samsung Exhibit II 4G aka Galaxy Exhibit 4G, I'm fairly happy with this purchase.08/14/13 Update: Still going strong, running Illusion ROM now. Also wanted to comment that if you want to use this phone on T-Mobile it's as simple as ordering a mini-SIM card from them and putting it in.(Obviously you need service too) If you already have a T-Mobile SIM card then you can take it to any T-Mobile store and they will resize it for you, otherwise it costs about $20 to get a replacement SIM.11/13/13 Update: Everything's good in Sonyland, I'm now running Omni ROM which has great performance so far, I've combined it with Xposed Framework + Modules to get back the features that are missing from other ROMs, everything works great. Battery life is pretty decent so far, depends on how much I use the screen and whether I'm on mobile data or not. If I'm at home all day on Wifi and not using my phone much besides listening to some stuff now and then and some socializing, I'm at 46% after 14 hours.Now, in the real world, when I'm working and out and about, I tend to get about 8-10 hours before I hit the 20% mark, but personally I use my phone a lot when I'm working for various things, Wifi hotspot and Wifi analyzer are probably the most draining, along with using the screen more simply to look stuff up. Some people might fare better, but even still in an age where you can find an outlet anywhere, and car chargers are fairly cheap, I don't really see any reason to be worried about the battery, unless you plan on watching videos all day, in which case you can expect the same 5 hour battery life as the Galaxy S4.Myself, I carry a 12000mAH(claimed) backup battery when I need to charge while working around since I don't like leaving my phone to sit by an outlet(plus it looks a little janky), but the only times I've truly needed this are during a convention where there was poor mobile data reception and wifi was outrageously priced, thus forcing my phone to work probably twice as hard to maintain a decent connection, thus draining the battery faster than normal.Also, I have to exclaim about the build quality on this phone as it seems to be really quite solid, due to various mishaps my phone has fallen a couple of times onto concrete from probably 3-4 feet with just some minor cosmetic damage mostly on the bottom left corner, what was really surprising was the second time I dropped it, now keep in mind I have a Skinomi screen protector which has kind of a soft springy feel to it, the second time I dropped it the phone had landed flat on it's face, when I picked it up I was amazed to see not a single scratch of damage.

"Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Black)","Sony","169.99","5","This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. The display is gorgeous, the processor is very fast, the camera is great, and it is waterproof!The Display:The 5 inch display on this phone has a resolution of 1080p. That is the same resolution as your HD tv on a 5 inch screen. This makes for 443 pixels per inch which results in an incredibly sharp picture. You cannot see pixels at all. The display also has Sony's Mobile Bravia Engine 2 which enhances color contrast while watching videos and viewing pictures. This really makes the pictures and videos pop, it makes them incredibly vivid. When the BE2 is not running the display's contrast is not as high, but you don't always need oversaturated colors. The viewing angles are far from stellar but most people will view the screen straight on anyways. Gaming with this screen really is a treat. The display is one of the best around.The Processor:This phone is powered by a quadcore 1.5 ghz Krait S4 chip coupled with 2gbs of ram. This results in incredibly fast performance even when multitaksing. The phone almost never lags. The Krait cores are very quick and are more than adequate, even with a 5 inch full HD display. All the games I have played run well. Browsing the internet is equally as snappy. Pages load quickly and smoothly. Zooming in and out is very quick as well.The quadcore processor in this really flexes its muscles in benchmark tests. I got around 7900 in the quadrant standard, over 2060 on the Geekbench 2, over 20,000 on Antutu, and over 2800 on Passmark Performance. All of these scores are higly impressive and show you what kind of power the device has. The performace does carry over to real world usage.The Cameras:The rear camera is 13.1 megapixels and takes incredible pictures. It has the Exmor RS sensor which adjusts numerous things for you. For the most part the results are stunning. Images come out clear and the colors are very vibrant. Occasionlay you will need to change a few setting around to get a better picture though. For example disabling flash. The camera never fails to impress me. With a camera like this there is no need to carry an actual digital camera around.The front facing camera is 2.2 megapixels and can shoot 1080p video. This is very impressive for a front facing camera because most of the current ones are only capable of 720p.The Buttons and Interface:This phone utilizes the on screen android buttons. They are very responsive and don't take up too much space. The side buttons (like the power button and volume rocker) are responsive and easy to press as well. I have no complaints about the buttons.Sony has there own overlay for the Android OS. It is very light and very pleasing to the eyes. It has many great features such as small apps. With small apps you can open a miniature app while running another at the same time, both on the screen. For example, you can open a calculator while on the browser. This feature can be incredibly useful and convenient. I prefer Sony's overlay over Samsung's TouchWiz. My only real complaint when it comes to Sony's overlay is that it lacks a default task manager.The on sceen keyboard is very responsive and auto-correct works well. Turning the phone sideways gives you a lot of room, especially if you have larger hands.The Music Player:A lot of people use their phones as there music players and some phones have horrible audio quality. This phone is not one of those phones. Audio quality is great and there are many different settings that you can adjust to get the best sound. You have five band equalizers and all kinds of different options such as a dynamic normailizer which adjusts the volume differences between songs. Even though the phone has all these options I find myselfy using the ""Clear Audio+"" option. This automatically adjusts the equalizers for each song and the result is great. All the songs sound nice and, well clear with this feature.The music player is very nice to look at, it changes color based on the album artwork which is very neat. You can create playlists on the phone and even edit the music info. If you spelled the name of a song wrong when transfering it, you can fix it right there on the phone. If you are missing album artwork you can get it right on the phone. I am very pleased with the music player on this device.The ""Waterproof featue"":This phone is designed to survive under one meter of water for up to half an hour at a time. While most people will avoid getting their phones wet it is a comforting feature to have. It is also a unique feature for a high end smartphone. It means you won't have to say ""bye"" to your phone if you drop it in the bathtub.The Battery Life:Battery life on the phone is decent. It is nothing great. I get about 1 and a half days of moderate to heavy usage before I have to charge it (with stamina mode enabled). The phone has ""Stamina Mode"" which turns off things while they are not in use. This does help the battery life quite and bit and is a useful feature.Connectivity:This phone is a GSM phone and is capable of HSPA+ 4G. This one is NOT LTE Capable. This is not a factor for me because my provider doesn't offer LTE.The wifi connector on this phone is good. It has a good range and is allows for a quick and strong connection. Of all the devices in my house it is able to get the fastest upload speeds on the exact same connection.Storage:The phone comes with 16gbs of storage but allows expansion via a micro sd card slot. Only about 11.7gbs of the internal storage are available for usage but if you have a micro sd card you can have more than a sufficient amount of storage for your pictures, music, videos, and applications. My only major complaint with the storage is that it doesn't allow the transfer of apps to the SD card. This feature would be very useful.Conclusion:This is an incredible phone and is a great deal. It offers incredible performance and an amazing display. Sony has a great overlay that is innovative and light on the processor. The camera is of stellar quality and the overall build of the phone is as well. It is not a cheap plastic phone. In addition it can survive being submerged in water which is something that no other phone in its class can boast. This is an outstanding phone and I am very satisfied with it!UPDATE (1/2/14):The phone is now running on android 4.3 and the newer OS brought many small improvements with it.Main Changes:-The Music Player is now much louder. It's about as loud as my Ipod Touch now.-The Camera UI has changed slightly. It's now more similar to the one found on the Z1.-You can now download additional theme packs from the Play Store.-The color calibration in the home screens and app screens has changed slightly.-Synthetic Benchmark scores have improved. The phone now scores about 9000 on Quadrant Standard.","120","helpful"
"Sony Ericsson C905a Unlocked Phone with Wi-Fi, 8 MP Camera and GPS - Unlocked Phone - International Version - Black","Sony Ericsson","114","2","I got the C905A AT&T locked phone. (I will get AT&T to unlock this phone in two years when its contract is up.)The phone and camera is fun.The instructions are deplorable. Someone fired any talent they might have had in the instruction manual department for sure! Maybe this is a result of meddling by ""the NEW AT&T"", I dont know but someone made an unholy mess of the owner's manual. Undefined terms, sloppy wording that is inaccurate, features not mentioned and other features with major subfeatures missing. For example there is no mention of MP3 anywhere in the manual and yet you can load songs with ease and the phone will play them. Instructions for operation of the volume control is wrong. Reference to ""hands free"" which term they dont bother to define: ""plug in the hands free"" to make an antenna for the FM.For the big money they ask for this phone I am disappointed.","6","helpful"

"Sony Ericsson Xperia Play R800i Unlocked Phone and Gaming Device with Android OS and Slide-Out Gamepad","Sony Ericsson","83.88","5","IMPORTANT: This device is NOT compatible with 3G on AT&T nor T-Mobile in United States. The spec of the R800""i"" version only support the HSDPA 900 / 2100 bands, which neither AT&T nor T-Mobile in the US support. You will only get 2G speed. The R800""at"" AT&T version use the 850 / 1900 / 2100 bands. The great thing about this is T-Mobile is beginning to enable support for 1900/2100 in various area, so if you manged to get an unlocked version of the R800at you can get 3G on T-Mobile if you happen to live in one of those 1900Mhz supported location.I have owned devices like the Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Nexus, I sold them and goes back to the Xperia Play because for someone who love classic console gaming there is no better choice as a phone. Bluetooth gamepads just doesn't do it for me because they're not really portable and can take time to setup.GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS DEVICE:-THE GAMEPAD: I won't have to explain this.-DURABILITY: It's quite durable and can easily withstand 'reasonable drops'. I have less concern about accidentally dropping this device than dropping highend devices with Gorilla Glass.-SOUND QUALITY: Audiophiles might realize that there are not a lot of Android phones with great sound quality. The headphone output quality is very good and to my ears comparable to the original Galaxy S which is another Android device with great sound.-aGPS and GLONASS support: This allow it to get reasonably fast location fix and stay fixed. Its not the most accurate, but for a being an older device its very acceptable and probably better than many other devices that only have aGPS.-CAMERA: For being a 5MP camera with LED flash it can take decent photos. It's about 90% as detailed as the Galaxy Nexus 5MP camera, but is better with low light situation. It can record videos at 720p with continuous autofocus. However, there is a big flaw with the camera microphone's volume being extremely quiet.The CONS:-Performance: Even at the time of release, this device have a hopelessly underpowered CPU and GPU combination and only ~400mb of usable RAM. It might not play some newer graphic intensive 3D games, however it does support many games. ""Classic gaming"" is where its at for this device.-Low brightness: The LCD display have accurate color, but is not very bright so can be hard to see under sunlight.-Will eventually get dirt underneath the screen because it's not properly sealed, unless you're a very clean and careful person.-Camera's microphone: As mentioned, the camera microphone's volume is extremely low, so recorded videos will be very quiet.-Small gamepad: Not a real con, but the gamepad of this device is a bit small so people with large hands might get cramps. I found the ""touchpad joysticks"" difficult to use.OVERALL: Even if you don't intend to use this as a phone, it makes a very good portable music and gaming device, especially if you are a fan of classic consoles. It take decent photos and have good GPS signal.Note: I killed this device by installing a ""wet-applied screen protector"", which caused the phone to short out, the digitizer stopped working and other components messing up. So I recommend to be careful with water/moisture and don't use wet screen protectors with this.Also read my comment on this review for more tips.","9","helpful"

"Sony Ericsson Xperia Play R800i Unlocked Phone and Gaming Device with Android OS and Slide-Out Gamepad","Sony Ericsson","83.88","5","Have had the phone for over a week now and no issues what so ever. Great phone, buttons work great and was in original packaging. The only thing that took a little bit of googleing was figuring out the difference between the types of Xperia Plays out there.The R800x is the Verizon version and only works on CDMA networks.The R800i is a GSM and CDMA international phone and will work in the states with Straight Talk, AT&T, TMobile and probably any other provider that offers a SIM card option. Takes a Sim card and is the one that I got and it gets excellent service and I live in the boonies.The R800a is the American version of the R800i and will work with the same carriers, the only difference is the initial programs that come preloaded on the phone.I bought the R800i because it was a little cheaper and the phone came ready to use, got a Straight Talk SIM card from the Walmart website and it was simply to get service started. Put the SIM card in, registered the unlimited minute pack on there website and added the APN information as described in the installation kit that came with the card. I was making calls and sending texts withing 3 min.The games on the phone look amazing for a cell phone and the controls are a big step up from fingering the screen and getting your thumbs in the middle of your view. They just work great for gaming. The screen itself is 720p which looks awesome on a 4 inch screen and enhances all the games beyond what I am used to. Would recommend to anyone gamers or not. Great phone. WIll update if any issues occur.Hope this helped save you some time.","18","helpful"

"Sony Ericsson Xperia Play R800i Unlocked Phone and Gaming Device with Android OS and Slide-Out Gamepad","Sony Ericsson","83.88","4","PROS: Beautiful phone. Impresive screen. Wi-FI, Bluetooth, GPS, Internet all work fine. Call audio excellent, good reception. A gamer must. Easy to use and get used to. Comes with a 8GB microSD.CONS: Game controler is a little small (and I don't have big hands). Also a little heavier than other phones. But the real problem is that sometimes while calling the screen goes blank, so you don't have access to any function, then things come back to normal (so i guess it must be something in the software). Also while playing, all of a sudden the game has shut down and automaticaly gone back to the home screen. Not very frequent but should be a perfect phone of this price.17/06/2011: A software update has practiaclly fixed all the bugs. No more closing programs or problems with the phone calls.

Similar camera features to Sony CyberShot Products, including BestShot, which is AWESOME!!!-Built-in flash, which is not as bright as stand-alone Digital Camera, however VERY useful-EXCELLENT battery life considering features. Held charge just as good as my W800i with less features.-Small, fits in ANY pocket decent-Screen Resolution is rather high, and the pixels are closer together to produce crisper images and refresh rates than other phones. This is something MOTOROLA has been horrible at, including the RAZR and SLVR-Display has EXCELLENT color compared to any product I've owned, and has glare-resistance in direct sunlight! Also has good viewing angle.-Joystick makes navigation fast and easy for internet, games, and phone operation-Durable for being so advanced-MemoryStick Micro is cheap, and compatible in many other of my Sony products (with its included adapter)-EXCELLENT call quality-SUPERB reception, unlike old SonyEricssons.

Very dissappointing.-Didn't come with external cord for listening to music like my W800i.-Only two color selections. I liked the Orange of my W800i.EXCELLENT OVERALL VALUE IF YOU WANT:-Phone with awesome reception & features, conference calling, etc.-MP3 player that sounds great-Camara that can be used anywhere, quickly, with a flash-Internet, Video Streams, RSS on the fly-High-speed Internet to your Laptop-UNIQUE.","6","helpful"
"Sony Ericsson K790a Phone (Unlocked)","Sony Ericsson Mobile","26.5","5","You all remember the StarTek; back in the late 90s it was THE flip phone. Since then no flip phone has ever been the same; I can't flip any of them with one hand with a flicking motion without thinking they'll fly against the wall.Since then, I have only gotten bar phones. This one is the best I've used, of any type of phone. Firstly, I love how Sony Ericcson's handle phonebooks; I don't know why but I like it. When Motorolas read my sim card they screw it up and don't read each contact's numbers as a group, they give each number an individual entry. I also think SEs have the sexiest fonts and graphics.The thing I like best about this phone is definately the fact that I can hook it up to my computer (it comes with a usb cable, separate from the charging cable, and a 50some MB memory card for starters; it can hold a lot though obviously it's not a portable hard drive but you can buy up to 2 GB so far, higher when you can buy the recently announced 4 GB card) and transfer images, videos, mp3s, and other files to/from the phone. That means I can make custom backgrounds, ringtones, alerts (video, image, or audial) on my computer and then put them on my phone without being charged for sending over the cell networks. Also, it has bluetooth and infrared, though I don't have any other devices that use these communication protocols.The real highlight of the phone, besides the fact that it doesn't drop calls ever, is the camera. 3 Megapixels is about the best you can get without buying from Asia and the quality is great. It's true, at night in large spaces where the light can't reflect back, some residuals show up as artifacts (discolorations) but not enough to detract from all the rest of the features. I feel like my phone's camera has more features than a real digital camera costing $600+. I'm gonna turn it on and try to cover them all:There is a 'frame' feature which puts preset cartoony drawings on the screen and then you take a picture that will show up behind it (like an astronaut suit.... so any picture you take will have an astronaut suit overlayed on top of it; it's a good gimmick for kids). There is a panoramic feature: you take 3 pictures from left to right and the camera will merge them for you. There is a feature called 'best pic' which is for drunk or motion pictures: the camera takes 9 pictures very quickly and you can check through all of them to see which ones you want to save. There are also tons of lighting, stability, and other options that I don't use because I trust the automatic settings (they have worked great so far). My favorite options are the effects: color, black and white, negative, orangey (like old-fashioned photos), and overexposed (like a painting). You can take videos in any one of these modes. The video of my girlfriend dancing naked around a pole with black stalkings and heels is the best video i've ever seen; it was taken in negative mode and her stalkings are white, her skin is blue, her hair is white, and so is her private area... it looks like the gates of heaven.After you take photos/videos, you can also edit them. You can zoom in/out and resave the picture, rotate it, add even more effects, overlay text, combine effects, you can trim videos. The only downside is, when I converted movie files from my computer to 3gp format and put them on my phone, I couldn't edit them in the on-phone video editor because they were too long. I can do that on my computer though; I was just too impatient.Also, the screen is large and quality; my friend asked me if this is high def. and I regularly jerk it to porn that I'm viewing on the phone. There is plenty of free software available from sony that you can download to the phone (some of which allows you to change the colors of menus, fonts, etc). Other features I like: mp3 player, fm radio player, tons of accessories you can buy. I have owned the phone for a month and a half, have been playing with it constantly, and I am still finding new features.People also like my phone; when I tell them it is so new that Cingular didn't know it existed when I called to verify that it'd work on their network (it does even though they said it wouldn't) and that the only place that sells it is amazon.com, I wonder if they are impressed. I think they are; I am.It sucks to have to pay $370 for a new phone but, screw it, when they release an even cooler phone that Cingular knows about, I will get that and sign up for the 2 year agreement.I'd bet that anyone who has the insight to buy this phone won't be disappointed.","6","helpful"

Dropped in pond, dropped off motorcycle (while moving), and often forget to insure. Many times just get bored. I have probably had all the brands, though not all models of course. And I'm hard on my phones. The best previous all around phone was Treo, and I still like the OS platform. But in terms of entertainment this phone is the best. The MP3 is easy to use and software is intuitive. Though still not sure if it accepts songs from iTunes. I've only loaded on my own CDs. FM reception very good, and I live in a poor reception area. The headphones are great, but I've always used Sony earbuds. Have not tried it for gaming yet, but will explore that. The camera is easy to use, good quality pictures, and screen can be seen in bright sunlight.And...oh yeah....it is a very good phone. This was my first experience with an unlocked phone but after installing the SIM from my prior drowned MDA it worked without a glitch. Blue tooth and hands free work well. I can even take calls while on motorcycle. Earbuds fit inside helmet and automatically cuts out MP3/radio.I would recommend this phoneI like the way it looks and has been sturdy so far.

Sony Ericsson interests me the most because of its slick design and rich functionalities. The Everchanging theme is awesome, which changes based on day and time, and the light effect is equally amazing. The 2MP camera is OK since it does not have auto focus, but it is good for some spontaneous moments where you wish you have a camera on you. BTW, you definitely want to get a M2 card to store more data, I recommend 2GB or larger.I have no complaint so far other than its expensive price tag, which seems to be the norm for SE phones anyway. Some people reported cracked keypads on earlier manufactured phones after months of usage, I hope they have address that issue.Oh yeah, it is beautiful but it is also a grease magnet so if you want to keep that shine, get some cover on it. ;)","10","helpful"

"Verizon Wireless 4G LTE MICRO SIM Card 3FF - Brand New and Unused","Verizon","3.5","5","After reading on the internet about all the unhappy iPad owners that had accidentally screwed up their SIM cards by cancelling prepaid cellular data plans because they deactivated their accounts instead of just stopping the payment plan, I was real nervous about whether this would work for my iPad 3. I had done the same, not realizing that deactivating my prepaid cellular account would make my SIM card worthless. Verizon had told me to go and get a new SIM card at a Verizon store back when I did the incorrect deactivation, but Verizon stores will not give out SIM cards unless you are putting your iPad on your regular monthly ""postpaid"" account, which I most definitely do not want to do.So I ordered this SIM card to try to resurrect prepaid cellular on my iPad 3. When the new SIM card came, I put it in my iPad and activated a new prepaid data plan (1GB) with Verizon. With one small problem, it worked fine, and now my iPad 3 is again able to use prepaid cellular data for our upcoming trip. I'm very relieved that all the speculation about not being able to use a prepaid data plan anymore is just not true. People even talked about exchanging their iPad's to get a new SIM card, but you definitely don't need to do that, just get a new SIM card like this one.The only problem that I had was an interesting one, and might help some of you out there. The activation of the cellular data stuff did not go through the first time that I tried it. Turns out that since I have a Verizon Network Extender, I had to disable that until cellular data was totally activated. Once the activation was completed, and I could actually use cellular data, I turned the Network Extender back on, and it's all working well. But for the time that the activation was processing, I had to have the Network Extender off.Also, the fact is that these SIM cards work for either postpaid and prepaid plans. There's no such thing as a ""prepaid SIM card"", there's only one kind of SIM card for your iPad.I'm very happy with the way that this has turned out. I was anticipating that I might not be able to use my iPad with cellular data at all, after having paid a bunch extra for that functionality. Good to go now!","32","helpful"

Storage: This phone comes in a cheaper 32GB model, as well as a more reasonable 64GB model. 32GB may be enough for most people, but this phone is clearly designed for a more particular audience in mind. This is where the 64GB model is more reasonable. I currently have all the updates as well as over 32GB of music on this phone, and still have 25+ GBs left. With the 32GB option, I would be in a bit of trouble. Now that they offer a 64GB option, however, the score for this phone is bumped up a bit. Overall Storage Score: 7.5/10 (would be higher with expandable storage option)3. Display: This phone sports a 5.5 inch display with a CGS-based LCD panel, operating at a native resolution of 2560x1440. I must say, this phone literally ""shines."" The display alone proves that this phone is a flagship device. This may not be Super-AMOLED, but with this quality, it really doesn't need to be. Colors are absolutely beautiful, and playing 1440p videos from Youtube shows how beautiful this display truly is. The touch sensitivity is spot on and the viewing angles are astonishing. Overall Display Score: 9/10 (It COULD be Super-AMOLED, but doesn't need to be at this price)4. Hardware: This phone packs a beast of a processor (the 8-core Snapdragon 810) with the Adreno 430 GPU. This phone can, and will, run anything you throw at it with ease. Surprisingly, this thing doesn't overheat like most devices sporting this chipset. At first it gets considerably warm, but never to the point of worry. Surprisingly, it got better over time with updates. I can manage to play an intensive game on it for a considerable amount of time before it even begins to warm up, and when it does heat up, it seems to stabilize and remain at a constant temperature. I am not sure what ZTE did to help alleviate the overheating issue, but it works.Furthermore, this phone packs a massive 4GBs of DDR3 RAM. Any tech enthusiast will appreciate this feature, especially those that multitask, as this phone does so with ease. Overall Hardware Score: 10/10 (This device is already overkill in the hardware department)5. Battery: This phone sports a rather average 3000mAH battery. For the Snapdragon 810 running within this, I would have liked a larger battery. However, this phone can get you through the day with average use. On the plus side, this phone features Quick Charge 2.0, and I must say that it charges incredibly (and I emphasize that) fast. Overall Battery Score: 7/10 (It could be better given the high-end hardware, but is made up for in extremely fast charging time)6. Speaker: This phone features a pretty impressive front-facing speaker. It does NOT have stereo speakers, so do not let the mesh design fool you. Regardless, for the one speaker it does have, it sounds good, and can get loud. That's about all I can say for this category. Overall Speaker Score: 8/10 (stereo speakers would have been nice with this design)7. Primary Camera: This phone packs an impressive dual-lense rear camera, the primary lense being 13MP, capable of taking very high-res photos (and believe me, they look spectacular). The focus on this camera is pretty good, and the speed at which the camera operates is fantastic. Low light photos could be better, however, although still not nearly the worst. The camera features a special bokeh mode as a result of its secondary (although somewhat gimmicky) OmniVision 2MP lense located above the main 13MP lense. The bokeh mode is a lot of fun to mess around with, and with some practice, you can pull off some professional-looking photos. The manual mode offers a TON of adjustable settings to toy around with to help capture that perfect shot when you have the time. Otherwise, the auto mode does an extremely good job at taking quick photos on its own. As a side note, the adjustable dual-LED flash works great as a flashlight, and can be extremely bright. Overall Primary Camera Score: 9/10 (There are a few flagships that give this camera competition, but those phones cost 2-3 times as much)8. Front Camera: The front-facing camera comes in at an impressive 8MPs. However, this number sounds more impressive on paper than it actually turns out to be in practice. In day to day use, the ""selfie"" camera (as many will call it) is average. It is by no means terrible, but it isn't quite the best put in a phone as of right now. However, it certainly gets the job done, and can pull off some decent photos in good lighting conditions. Overall Front Camera Score: 7/10 (It takes decent photos, but does not match the specs of the rest of the phone in practice)9. Video: Yes, I am separating the video capture from the primary camera. I have seen, time and again, lacking video on phones that take decent pictures. This is simply not the case here. This phone is capable of taking very crisp 4K videos at 30FPS without a hitch. Run it in 720p, and you can capture video at 120FPS. That framerate leaves room for a feature that is becoming more common in flagship phones: slow motion capture. And boy does this phone capture slow motion well. Many phones, even flagships, feature slo-mo capture, but have a little lag in the final output. That is not the case at all here. Jump in the camera, and you are ready to take a smooth video at 120FPS to be processed in slo-mo for your enjoyment, and it looks buttery smooth, easily competing with the likes of the newest iPhones (something that can't be said for most devices in this category). You can also take pictures while capturing video, which is a nice touch. Overall Video Score: 9/10 (It can always be better)10. Software: This phone runs Android 5.1.1 out of the box, but within two updates, offers an upgrade to Android 6.0. So far, I have had nothing but a wonderful and smooth time with this OS... no hitches, no glitches, nothing. It was a seamless transition. I advise anyone that buys this phone to upgrade to Android 6.0 the moment they boot up the phone and connect to WiFi. Bloatware was kept to a minimum, and the 2 or 3 gimmicky apps they include can easily be disabled right from the start. What we are left with is a near-stock Android experience, ensuring that the 8-core processor and 4GB of RAM is ever more overkill than it needs to be. This has been the smoothest Android experience I have ever had. Overall Software Score: 10/10 (Finally, a company follows the trend that makes the Nexus/Moto series so successful, but with overkill hardware to top it off)11. Audio (Input): This phone features an impressive AK4490 DAC, used to help your headphones pull off a more dynamic sound. As such, this phone is an extremely good music player. The included JBL E13 earbuds are the best I have ever seen shipped with a mobile device, period. In fact, I prefer them over my $40 SoundMagic E10 earbuds, which are pretty good on their own. I can definitely see why these earbuds retail at $50. JBL has been in the audio business for quite some time, and as an audiophile, I can confirm that it shows in the stock earbuds.Regardless, marketing the DAC as ""32-bit"" capable is gimmicky at best, as literally no one will be able to hear the signal-to-noise ratio difference between that and their standard 24-bit playback. Bit-depth does not necessarily mean better audio resolution/accuracy. Where this thing really shines is in its ability to amplify your headphones. It is clear that this is the absolute best sounding smartphone ever developed from a DAC standpoint. The dynamic range, from an objective standpoint, wipes the floor with other flagships, and there is solid science behind this claim. The THD (total harmonic distortion) is also lower than the other flagships. Literally no phone competes in the audio/DAC category. Overall Input Audio Score: 10/10 (There is no phone that competes, period)Summary: Who is this phone for? Everyone that wants a flagship phone that doesn't want to jump in on the latest hype of the likes of Samsung or Apple. Do I recommend this phone? It is impossible for me to not recommend this phone. You must absolutely buy this phone if you have the money. It makes you wonder why other flagships cost so much.And yes, the Moto X finally has tough competition that isn't from OnePlus.","19","helpful"

Coming from a Samsung Galaxy s5 that was so buggy and lagged so much I literally folded it in half and a HTC m7 that's battery ran so often I had to constantly keep it plugged in defeating the whole purpose of a cell phone, I have to say this ZTE z max 2 blew me away!!! It functions flawlessly and is more stable than my big name brand Samsung ever was!!! The battery lasts ALL day! Simply put I am amazed at this phone. The only tiny complaint that I have is its inability to accept a 64gb micro SD card but that has really been a non issue anyway.I just can't say enough for such an affordable phone.

In day to day use, the ""selfie"" camera (as many will call it) is average. It is by no means terrible, but it isn't quite the best put in a phone as of right now. However, it certainly gets the job done, and can pull off some decent photos in good lighting conditions. Overall Front Camera Score: 7/10 (It takes decent photos, but does not match the specs of the rest of the phone in practice)9. Video: Yes, I am separating the video capture from the primary camera. I have seen, time and again, lacking video on phones that take decent pictures. This is simply not the case here. This phone is capable of taking very crisp 4K videos at 30FPS without a hitch. Run it in 720p, and you can capture video at 120FPS. That framerate leaves room for a feature that is becoming more common in flagship phones: slow motion capture. And boy does this phone capture slow motion well. Many phones, even flagships, feature slo-mo capture, but have a little lag in the final output. That is not the case at all here. Jump in the camera, and you are ready to take a smooth video at 120FPS to be processed in slo-mo for your enjoyment, and it looks buttery smooth, easily competing with the likes of the newest iPhones (something that can't be said for most devices in this category). You can also take pictures while capturing video, which is a nice touch. Overall Video Score: 9/10 (It can always be better)10. Software: This phone runs Android 5.1.1 out of the box, but within two updates, offers an upgrade to Android 6.0. So far, I have had nothing but a wonderful and smooth time with this OS... no hitches, no glitches, nothing. It was a seamless transition. I advise anyone that buys this phone to upgrade to Android 6.0 the moment they boot up the phone and connect to WiFi. Bloatware was kept to a minimum, and the 2 or 3 gimmicky apps they include can easily be disabled right from the start. What we are left with is a near-stock Android experience, ensuring that the 8-core processor and 4GB of RAM is ever more overkill than it needs to be. This has been the smoothest Android experience I have ever had. Overall Software Score: 10/10 (Finally, a company follows the trend that makes the Nexus/Moto series so successful, but with overkill hardware to top it off)11. Audio (Input): This phone features an impressive AK4490 DAC, used to help your headphones pull off a more dynamic sound. As such, this phone is an extremely good music player. The included JBL E13 earbuds are the best I have ever seen shipped with a mobile device, period. In fact, I prefer them over my $40 SoundMagic E10 earbuds, which are pretty good on their own. I can definitely see why these earbuds retail at $50. JBL has been in the audio business for quite some time, and as an audiophile, I can confirm that it shows in the stock earbuds.Regardless, marketing the DAC as ""32-bit"" capable is gimmicky at best, as literally no one will be able to hear the signal-to-noise ratio difference between that and their standard 24-bit playback. Bit-depth does not necessarily mean better audio resolution/accuracy. Where this thing really shines is in its ability to amplify your headphones. It is clear that this is the absolute best sounding smartphone ever developed from a DAC standpoint. The dynamic range, from an objective standpoint, wipes the floor with other flagships, and there is solid science behind this claim. The THD (total harmonic distortion) is also lower than the other flagships. Literally no phone competes in the audio/DAC category. Overall Input Audio Score: 10/10 (There is no phone that competes, period)Summary: Who is this phone for? Everyone that wants a flagship phone that doesn't want to jump in on the latest hype of the likes of Samsung or Apple. Do I recommend this phone? It is impossible for me to not recommend this phone. You must absolutely buy this phone if you have the money. It makes you wonder why other flagships cost so much.And yes, the Moto X finally has tough competition that isn't from OnePlus.","20","helpful"
"ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Phone, 64 GB Phthalo Blue (U.S. Warranty)","ZTE","379.98","5","$320 for this phone was an absolute steal.Let's break this phone down part by part.1. Build: You can NOT take the back cover off in order to expand storage. The SIM tray is located on the side of the phone. However, the aluminum body of this phone makes this phone incredibly sturdy in the hand. The Gorilla Glass on the front is very smooth around the edges as the side of the phone connects to the front. This gives the phone a very luxurious feel. Overall Build Score: 9/10 (-1 for its non-serviceable design)2. Storage: This phone comes in a cheaper 32GB model, as well as a more reasonable 64GB model. 32GB may be enough for most people, but this phone is clearly designed for a more particular audience in mind. This is where the 64GB model is more reasonable. I currently have all the updates as well as over 32GB of music on this phone, and still have 25+ GBs left. With the 32GB option, I would be in a bit of trouble. Now that they offer a 64GB option, however, the score for this phone is bumped up a bit. Overall Storage Score: 7.5/10 (would be higher with expandable storage option)3. Display: This phone sports a 5.5 inch display with a CGS-based LCD panel, operating at a native resolution of 2560x1440. I must say, this phone literally ""shines."" The display alone proves that this phone is a flagship device. This may not be Super-AMOLED, but with this quality, it really doesn't need to be. Colors are absolutely beautiful, and playing 1440p videos from Youtube shows how beautiful this display truly is. The touch sensitivity is spot on and the viewing angles are astonishing. Overall Display Score: 9/10 (It COULD be Super-AMOLED, but doesn't need to be at this price)4. Hardware: This phone packs a beast of a processor (the 8-core Snapdragon 810) with the Adreno 430 GPU. This phone can, and will, run anything you throw at it with ease. Surprisingly, this thing doesn't overheat like most devices sporting this chipset. At first it gets considerably warm, but never to the point of worry. Surprisingly, it got better over time with updates. I can manage to play an intensive game on it for a considerable amount of time before it even begins to warm up, and when it does heat up, it seems to stabilize and remain at a constant temperature. I am not sure what ZTE did to help alleviate the overheating issue, but it works.Furthermore, this phone packs a massive 4GBs of DDR3 RAM. Any tech enthusiast will appreciate this feature, especially those that multitask, as this phone does so with ease. Overall Hardware Score: 10/10 (This device is already overkill in the hardware department)5. Battery: This phone sports a rather average 3000mAH battery. For the Snapdragon 810 running within this, I would have liked a larger battery. However, this phone can get you through the day with average use. On the plus side, this phone features Quick Charge 2.0, and I must say that it charges incredibly (and I emphasize that) fast. Overall Battery Score: 7/10 (It could be better given the high-end hardware, but is made up for in extremely fast charging time)6. Speaker: This phone features a pretty impressive front-facing speaker. It does NOT have stereo speakers, so do not let the mesh design fool you. Regardless, for the one speaker it does have, it sounds good, and can get loud. That's about all I can say for this category. Overall Speaker Score: 8/10 (stereo speakers would have been nice with this design)7. Primary Camera: This phone packs an impressive dual-lense rear camera, the primary lense being 13MP, capable of taking very high-res photos (and believe me, they look spectacular). The focus on this camera is pretty good, and the speed at which the camera operates is fantastic. Low light photos could be better, however, although still not nearly the worst. The camera features a special bokeh mode as a result of its secondary (although somewhat gimmicky) OmniVision 2MP lense located above the main 13MP lense. The bokeh mode is a lot of fun to mess around with, and with some practice, you can pull off some professional-looking photos. The manual mode offers a TON of adjustable settings to toy around with to help capture that perfect shot when you have the time. Otherwise, the auto mode does an extremely good job at taking quick photos on its own. As a side note, the adjustable dual-LED flash works great as a flashlight, and can be extremely bright. Overall Primary Camera Score: 9/10 (There are a few flagships that give this camera competition, but those phones cost 2-3 times as much)8. Front Camera: The front-facing camera comes in at an impressive 8MPs. However, this number sounds more impressive on paper than it actually turns out to be in practice.

"ZTE Z431 Unlocked GSM Phone with 2.4"" Display, 2MP Camera, QWERTY Keyboard, GPS, SNS Integration, Muisic Player and microSD Slot - Black","ZTE","21.8","5","First, let me say that I am not a techy person and I use my Kindle Fire with my ATT data plan. I didn't want a smart phone. Something went wrong with my ATT LG and I was still under contract with ATT so I came here to find an unlocked replacement. First I bought the Pantec P7040 Link. I was very disappointed with this phone, so many things that it couldn't do (see review of it elsewhere) But I just thought I'd suck it up until I could get another freebie with ATT. Luckily, the port was messed up so it became very difficult to charge only three weeks after I bought it and I was able to return it. Then I bought this phone to replace it. So many good things about it. The phone book is better than any phone I have owned. For example,if you accidentally miss pressing the first digit that you are calling but hit the next 3 or 4 digits, it pulls up and lists ANY number that has those 3 or 4 digits in a row. All of my other phones just would read ""No such contact"" or something to the like and you had to reenter the number. This phone was very easy to pair with the Sync feature in my Ford Escape, works great. The alarm function is much better than any others I've had too. The Pantec would only allow me to set a certain time alarm for ""Once"", ""Mon - Fri"" ""Fri-Sun"" or ""Everyday"". I work M, W, Th and get up at 4:00 a.m. so this was a serious limitation for me. This phone can be customized very easily. It is also of putting out the LOUDEST alarm that I have ever heard. I am a very light sleeper. So light that I wear earplugs and have a noise machine cranked up so I can't hear a pin drop. This works great but some phones aren't loud enough to overpower the loud noise and my blocked ears. This one does it easily. Shortcuts work well. Messaging is easy. I will say that the one downside is that the buttons are very small. This doesn't matter to me since I am very small, but a larger person may have trouble with the keys.If you don't care about all the bells and whistles of the smart phones and just want a very good phone with pretty good features that are easy to use for little money, this one is for you. I love it. If ATT offered me another phone for free right now to re-up with them, I would decline.","20","helpful"
"ZTE Axon 7 unlocked smartphone,64GB Grey (US Warranty)","ZTE","399.99","5","Coming from htc one m9 this phone is a HUGE upgrade across the board, even the audio experience is 5x better, which is saying a lot considering that htc one m9 used to be king of audio. This phone also looks like it was designed by a jewel crafter or watch maker, you have to see it in person to appreciate its beauty. Super fast and fluid, really nice software touches, instant fingerprint sensor (can store 5 fingers). AMAZING display, this phone easily goes toe to toe with the s7, and in my opinion is a good bit better then LG g5, EASILY BEATS HTC 10, oneplus3, etc. The s7 is really its only competition, and at this price point there is no comparison.","21","helpful"

First of all on the second charge... Yes 2nd Charge of the phone, it stopped working. Now my first thought was the outlet, so I changed the outlet, Nope. I thought then what the hell Im just gonna take it apart. And what did I find..... One of the capacitors exploded inside the casing of the charger. Thats just horrible I would have been more than happy to have a problem with the charger a year from now but on the 2nd charge?? Come on now...

"ZTE Z431 Unlocked GSM Phone with 2.4"" Display, 2MP Camera, QWERTY Keyboard, GPS, SNS Integration, Muisic Player and microSD Slot - Black","ZTE","21.8","4","I purchased this phone for several reasons and it has proven to be a great purchase. First, I needed a new MP3 player that was rechargeable, played for at least 12 hours per charge and would handle free library Overdrive books. My small clip-on Sansa disk players were great while they lasted, but completely unreliable. After the 6th $40 player quit after only a couple of weeks I gave up on them. I also needed a prepaid phone that would allow me to text with ease, but discovered that a prepaid plan for a smart phone was always at least $10/mo more, even if I never used data. I have a tablet and don't need an expensive smart phone too. With the unlocked Z431, for $30 I was getting a good MP3 player, a phone that made texting easy and only had one item to carry with me instead of two. In addition, this phone has bluetooth so I was able to ditch the earbuds with cords that kept getting in the way. I can use the phone for talking and playing books for several days without having to charge it (never done that with a smartphone). The phone was AT&T unlocked so I could get a free Sim from PureTalk USA which has a unique plan allowing me to pay as little as $10/month for minutes or automatically adds blocks of time if I need more, with extra minutes rolling over. I use anywhere from 200 to 800 minutes a month so this flexibility means I don't run out, and don't pay for minutes I never use as I did on a previous StraightTalk plan. The phone/media player is not perfect (hence 4 stars}. I wish it played wma as well as mp3 format books, but since most are available in both formats can live with that. A 5-star phone would also have a sleep timer and flashlight.Adding books was a definite learning process so I am including the steps to doing that here.1) You must purchase and insert a memory card.2.) Download the software and Overdrive books to your computer using your library site.3.) Connect the phone to your computer via USB and wait for Windows to load drivers4) Go to Computer to find the player symbol under Players with Removable Storage and double click5) A window with ""U Drive"" should pop up. Single click (important) on U drive.6) Wait for a couple of minutes - it takes time to load and I was sure it was not working the first few times I tried it because I did not wait long enough. The first file menu that pops up is for the phone, when a second longer menu appears you will be able to use the Overdrive transfer option from your computer to get the files on to your phone.These steps were from my Windows 7 computer.Other things I like:The calendar with audio reminders of my appointments.The keyboard that I find easy to use in spite of the tiny keys. Maybe it works because the keys are raised. The numbers are small, but since most of the phone numbers I call are stored, I rarely have to enter a phone number.","24","helpful"

It seems that the signal strength is a bit lower then other phones I've used but didn't have any problem from my work so far.After using the phone for a month or so, battery failed on me. Tried a few different chargers/cable to see if that was the issue but the device wouldn't charge at all. After talking to tech su]ort, sent it via fedex.Roughly about 3 weeks later phone arrived, however, it is not the one that I sent to them.Some screen protecting film is on it and it has scratches all over it. And s/n is different then the one I sent.Looks to me they sent me pre owned/ refurbished device instead of the one I sent.Was expecting to get the one I sent for repair.

The only flaw about this phone might be the battery, as it died within a day, standby. This was a disappointment, since most old flipphone a can last days on end with standby, and since this was for a person who can forget to charge his phone, that is really important.

"ZTE Axon 7 unlocked smartphone,64GB Grey (US Warranty)","ZTE","399.99","5","Aesthetically this phone is beautiful. It's sleek and slim with a metal body. A minor drawback may be that the slick feel of the phone make sit a bit slippery. This hasn't caused any issues for me, but I could see it being problematic for some people. The fingerprint sensor is located on the back of the phone which is very convenient as opposed to the front where you have to struggle a bit more to get print recognition. The speakers being on the front is a nice feature so that the music/sound comes towards you while you watch or listen to entertainment . The camera does protrude from the back of the phone a bit, but it really doesn't present that much of a problem. The brand labeling is on the back of the phone, not emblazoned across the front and taking up valuable real estate.Overall the phone is light, but feels well made and solid. A good size in your hand, not too large and uncomfortable. The colors appear on the screen with great clarity. The black is deep and the colors are vivid and clear. Screen responsiveness is very quick, no lag so far. Moving from page to page is seamless, apps open with no issue or delay. Notifications are available by tapping bell icon every time. No longer do they automatically show in your lock screen notifications. This could be a benefit or drawback depending on how you feel about a long list of notifications.Call quality is great, both on the calling and receiving end. The two front facing speakers sound tremendous, perhaps the best I've heard (last phone was a LG G5 and had the Galaxy S6 Edge prior to that, for reference). As I mentioned before, apps and programs are working without issue, even large programs seem to run without any delay. Response time in these programs to screen touch is immediate.The camera on this phone is pretty decent in quality. Not likely to win you a Nat Geo photo of the year prize, but more than enough for the casual selfie taker.Phone has dual sim card capability or can be used with a sim and micro sd card. Options are always good!(Worth noting, the phone came with a set of ear buds and a case. The earbuds are fantastic while the case leaves a bit to be desired, good to use while you wait to get the case you want, maybe?)Edited to add that the Android Nougat became available today and I've already been able to download and use it.Also forgot to mention that with the purchase of this phone comes a 2 year warranty called Passport 2.0 which should protect against accidental damage and allows for a $100 credit towards your next (ZTE) phone should this one be lost or stolen.","52","helpful"
"ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Phone, 64 GB Chromium Silver (U.S. Warranty)","ZTE","339","5","For those who don't want to read the full review read the TL;DR below:With high-powered specs under the hood, a beautiful 2560 X 1440 display, a simple and elegant design, Android Marshmallow almost out of the box and support for almost all GSM, HSPA and LTE bands, there's a lot to be had for with this unlocked smartphone for not a lot of coin (relatively). The ZTE Axon Pro is a budget-friendly beast that you will fall in love with if you give it a chance.Pros:+ Snapdragon 810, 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage+ Support for most WCDMA/GSM carriers LTE bands (supports all of T-Mo's frequency bands FYI)+ VoLTE support for carriers that support it (Band 12 for T-Mo)+ Carrier aggregration for areas and networks that support it (Band 2/4 + Band 12 for T-Mo, CA support for AT&T also)+ Wi-Fi calling/texting (confirmed on T-Mobile)+ Simple, elegant design with a premium look and feel+ Relatively affordable compared to other flagships with comparable specs (such as Nexus 6P, OnePlus Two, etc.)+ Android Marshmallow almost out of the box (2 updates once connected to WiFi had me at 6.0)+ Great dual lens camera that actually takes good pictures+ Quick Charge feature that can take battery from 10% to 80~85% in 60 minutes+ 2 year manufacturers warranty (U.S. Model)+ Comes packaged with high-quality JBL headphones that sound great with the phone+ Capacitive touch buttons that allow full use of gorgeous 1440P displayCons:- Battery life isn't the most optimal (has gotten much better since 2 software updates to 6.0 and some settings tweaks)- Signal sometimes drops for a second when switching frequency bands and isn't always immediate to pick up new frequency; signal isn't always as strong as it should be on LTE- No double-tap to wake (could be fixed in a software update)- Only one front-facing speaker (albeit a powerful and clear sounding one)- Some bloat apps pre-installed (can be disabled, but not fully uninstalled)- No expandable storageSo I bought this phone to replace my Oneplus One 64GB phone which was getting a little long in the tooth, but the main reason it was replaced was that although the OPO supported LTE with T-Mobile and Family Mobile it didn't support many of the LTE bands. I just recently went on a road trip and during driving anytime I got out of any large city the LTE support would drop and I would go to Edge or no signal. Meanwhile, my wife who had the LG G Stylo would have full LTE coverage. Well, this was kind of a deal-breaker and so after a lot of research and going back and forth between this phone and the Huawei Nexus 6P, I finally pulled the trigger and bought this phone over the Nexus 6P. Don't get me wrong, the Nexus 6P is a beautiful phone and I have for the most part loved the Nexus devices and what they offer (unlocked phone, premium specs for an affordable price and the latest and most pure stock Android experience) but there are a couple reasons I chose this over the Nexus 6P and Oneplus Two.Specs:The ZTE Axon Pro has specs that may not be able to keep up with the flagships currently just coming out, but it goes toe-to-toe with the big boys that released this past year and still comes out holding it's own. This phone comes with a Snapdragon 810 (same as Nexus 6P and OPT), 4GB RAM (1GB more than the Nexus 6P 3GB), 64GB internal storage (for this model reviewed but also comes in 32GB flavor). While the Nexus 6P does come in all the way up to 128GB internal storage, it will cost you much more than what this 64GB model is going for as of now. It also has support for most U.S. LTE Bands (LTE bands 2/3/4/5/7/12/13/17/29/30) which should give you a variety of options of network providers and MVNOs to choose from when it comes to usability.Price/Bang for buck factor:With the above listed specs, I was able to get the 64GB Ion Gold variant for about $325 right here on Amazon with free two-day Prime shipping. In comparison the Nexus 6P is running about $550 USD here on Amazon (although I have seen it on sale on the Egg for $500 for the Gold variant previously but still have to pay shipping sometimes). Likewise the Oneplus Two has just recently been reduced to $350 for the 64GB variant, but you have to pay shipping). Anyway, you will be hard pressed to find a phone with these specs for this price and if you don't need the 64GB storage internal, you can always opt for the 32GB version which is now running for about $300 as of this writing.Performance:Since I have fired this thing up, it connected right away (although I had to manually set the APN settings to get proper data connectivity) with Family Mobile (T-Mobile MVNO). Signal has been overall clear and call quality good. Even with many apps open, this thing doesn't miss a beat. No stutters, hangs or crashes. No overheating issues that I could detect (although it did feel a little warm upon first start up, after first update no more warmness). Battery life can sometimes leave something to be desired on moderate use, but once updated to Android Marshmallow 6.0 and one change to WiFi settings (set to Turn off when Asleep), battery life has gotten much better and I can make it through the day until the evening one one charge even with some moderate use (web surfing, streaming music and some playing games). This is even if I unplug the phone off the charger the evening before instead of the morning of. Again battery still leaves something to be desired, but it can be expected somewhat due to a large 1440p display and a powerful chip powering this thing. Also, even when battery life is depleted due to heavy use it is offset by having Quick Charge feature when using the supplied wall charger. I found from testing the provided wall charger will get the phone from 10% to 80~85% within 60 minutes, dependent on the features I have turned on in the background (Wi-Fi, etc.). I neglected to mention that in my original review, but a commenter mentioned it (thanks BTW!) and I wanted to add the extra info. Close to stock Android interface and not much pre-installed bloat ensures this thing runs smooth. Driving across from Las Vegas to Utah this thing maintained overall constant connectivity and data streaming with music for most of the whole trip, although there was a brief second when switching frequencies that the phone dropped connectivity and when I had one small dead zone the phone took a while to reconnect. I don't know if this is normal or a cause for concern and if so, then I will return. The good news is there is a 2-year warranty if the phone stops working then they will repair or replace at no cost to me for extended coverage. If within 35 days of purchase it is defective, I can get a full refund which is a comfort. If within 30 days I have buyer's remorse over purchasing this phone, I can get a refund but I have to pay the cost of shipping. It's a peace of mind that helps when purchasing this device and adds value to the purchase. Unless something goes wrong with it, I don't see myself returning it.Design:The Axon ZTE Pro has a premium look and feel that is comparable to the Nexus 6P. It has a slightly raised glass finish on the front and grill design on the top ear piece area and down on the single speaker (which is actually quite powerful sounding). The back has simple lines and design with an Axon logo. It comes in 3 colors, which is a Gold (my model), Blue (although it's very dark colored) and a Silver. I probably would have chose the Pthalo Blue or Silver if they'd been in stock, but the gold is actually quite nice to look at once you see it. The rear has dual lens camera that works actually really well and has a fast shutter speed. I was able to get some really good pics with it and my inner shutterbug started to come out while I was down on the Vegas strip. Still hard to catch one of my sons in motion, but he's like a humming bird with how fast he moves. There is also a dual flash on the back, but I haven't had to use it in auto mode. The biggest shame is covering this thing in the hybrid armor case I purchased for this kind of covered up the neat design of the phone. Lots of internal storage for taking pictures and downloading music, but bear in mind there isn't any expandable storage which is one reason I bought the 64GB variant. If you save most of your stuff to the cloud the limitation of storage isn't much of an issue.Well, this review is getting longer than I expected and it's getting late but just to wrap up, this is a budget flagship that will go toe-to-toe with the best of them and comes out in the top three or so devices. If you give it a chance, you will find there's a great phone to be had here for not a lot of coin. It makes a few compromises (no fingerprint scanner, no expandable storage, etc.) but if none of those are deal breakers than give it a try and you won't be sorry. I am glad I pulled the trigger on this phone and would recommend the same to a friend or someone else I know. I hope this phone and this company (ZTE) get a lot more attention and credit for what they've done here: a solid flagship phone at an affordable price with timely software updates, making a great daily driver.UPDATE 3/9/16:So after a week of use and a little more in-depth testing, a couple updates to some of the issues I was experiencing (or thought I was experiencing) and a weird random issue that happened today. First, regarding the belief that I was getting weak LTE signal compared to my wife's LG G Stylo (T-Mobile branded phone) on T-Mobiles network as comparing the cell phone signal status bar would show 1-2 bars on my LTE signal whereas hers would show 3-4 bars (of full bars). After doing some in depth testing/comparison within the native settings and within a free app called LTE Discovery (great app BTW), I found my signal strength was just as strong if not a little stronger than my wife's LG G Stylo. Upon refreshing network on both phones, my phone ranged from -107 to -104 dbm (lower is better) while my wife's phone was -107 to -106 dbm. As I said before, my data reception has been good as well as call quality data.Second, as time has gone on since the Android 6.0 and after turning Wi-Fi to turn off in sleep mode in the settings, my battery life has gotten even better and a full charge will last me not only all day but ~24 hours with light-moderate use and until the evening when using heavily or playing games. Light-moderate use includes web browsing, streaming music and watching Youtube videos. When playing intensive games during heavy use the battery goes much faster, but that's to be expected.Last random issue that just came up was what I thought was initially a malfunction, turned out to be after some research and reading the instruction manual was due to a dedicated camera button (that I was unaware of) being unexpectedly turned on while on the road due to my protective case and the phone mount where it was gripping said case. So if you are going to mount the phone in a phone clip keep the area clear where the dedicated camera button is (bottom right button below power button). As I use this phone more, I am really coming to like it even more! If it had external SD (can't complain with 64GB internal storage though) and double-tap to wake (can be fixed with update ZTE!) this would be the perfect phone!UPDATES 2 & 3 3/24/16: After some lengthy road trips and torture testing, with constant screen awake, Google Maps running with GPS location on, and streaming music over LTE data I average over 3.5+ hours total screen-on time. If I charge it the evening before and take off charger around 8PM, battery will last me until 4-5 PM (towards end of work day) on a single charge with web browsing, music streaming, etc.After recently switching to T-Mobile post-paid, I can confirm personally VoLTE is working on voice calls! I made a couple calls while on 4G LTE and signal remained on 4G LTE while calling and during voice call whereas before on Walmart Family Mobile, it would switch to HSPA+ during call and then back to 4G LTE afterwards (this also leads me to believe T-Mo is at least testing Band 12 in my area). Also, if you aren't a tech geek like me and don't know why you should care, let me just say calls on VoLTE are super clear and sound amazing! They also come thru louder as well as clearer. I was calling someone from outside and the person was inside a building and it sounded like I was right next to the person. Also, tried Wi-Fi calling and texting and even on a mediocre hotel Wi-Fi hot-spot call quality sounded pretty good. Texts can be sent on Wi-Fi as well. This was not supported on Family Mobile, but is on T-Mo postpaid so keep that in mind. As I use this phone more, I keep finding new features and things that make owning this phone even more awesome. Also if you are on T-Mobile post-paid and are looking for an affordable flagship phone that takes advantage of all the advantages the carrier provides (Band 12 extended range LTE, VoLTE support, CA Band support, Wi-Fi calling/texting, etc.) getting this phone is a no-brainer!NOTE: Screenshot I uploaded was only edited to remove the personal information of the phone number, but this is an actual screenshot from my ZTE Axon Pro while on a voice call showing still on 4G LTE. Again, if VoLTE wasn't active it will switch to 4G (HSPA+) signal.","56","helpful"

"ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Phone, 64 GB Phthalo Blue (U.S. Warranty)","ZTE","379.98","5","For those who don't want to read the full review read the TL;DR below:With high-powered specs under the hood, a beautiful 2560 X 1440 display, a simple and elegant design, Android Marshmallow almost out of the box and support for almost all GSM, HSPA and LTE bands, there's a lot to be had for with this unlocked smartphone for not a lot of coin (relatively). The ZTE Axon Pro is a budget-friendly beast that you will fall in love with if you give it a chance.Pros:+ Snapdragon 810, 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage+ Support for most WCDMA/GSM carriers LTE bands (supports all of T-Mo's frequency bands FYI)+ VoLTE support for carriers that support it (Band 12 for T-Mo)+ Carrier aggregration for areas and networks that support it (Band 2/4 + Band 12 for T-Mo, CA support for AT&T also)+ Wi-Fi calling/texting (confirmed on T-Mobile)+ Simple, elegant design with a premium look and feel+ Relatively affordable compared to other flagships with comparable specs (such as Nexus 6P, OnePlus Two, etc.)+ Android Marshmallow almost out of the box (2 updates once connected to WiFi had me at 6.0)+ Great dual lens camera that actually takes good pictures+ Quick Charge feature that can take battery from 10% to 80~85% in 60 minutes+ 2 year manufacturers warranty (U.S. Model)+ Comes packaged with high-quality JBL headphones that sound great with the phone+ Capacitive touch buttons that allow full use of gorgeous 1440P displayCons:- Battery life isn't the most optimal (has gotten much better since 2 software updates to 6.0 and some settings tweaks)- Signal sometimes drops for a second when switching frequency bands and isn't always immediate to pick up new frequency; signal isn't always as strong as it should be on LTE- No double-tap to wake (could be fixed in a software update)- Only one front-facing speaker (albeit a powerful and clear sounding one)- Some bloat apps pre-installed (can be disabled, but not fully uninstalled)- No expandable storageSo I bought this phone to replace my Oneplus One 64GB phone which was getting a little long in the tooth, but the main reason it was replaced was that although the OPO supported LTE with T-Mobile and Family Mobile it didn't support many of the LTE bands. I just recently went on a road trip and during driving anytime I got out of any large city the LTE support would drop and I would go to Edge or no signal. Meanwhile, my wife who had the LG G Stylo would have full LTE coverage. Well, this was kind of a deal-breaker and so after a lot of research and going back and forth between this phone and the Huawei Nexus 6P, I finally pulled the trigger and bought this phone over the Nexus 6P. Don't get me wrong, the Nexus 6P is a beautiful phone and I have for the most part loved the Nexus devices and what they offer (unlocked phone, premium specs for an affordable price and the latest and most pure stock Android experience) but there are a couple reasons I chose this over the Nexus 6P and Oneplus Two.Specs:The ZTE Axon Pro has specs that may not be able to keep up with the flagships currently just coming out, but it goes toe-to-toe with the big boys that released this past year and still comes out holding it's own. This phone comes with a Snapdragon 810 (same as Nexus 6P and OPT), 4GB RAM (1GB more than the Nexus 6P 3GB), 64GB internal storage (for this model reviewed but also comes in 32GB flavor). While the Nexus 6P does come in all the way up to 128GB internal storage, it will cost you much more than what this 64GB model is going for as of now. It also has support for most U.S. LTE Bands (LTE bands 2/3/4/5/7/12/13/17/29/30) which should give you a variety of options of network providers and MVNOs to choose from when it comes to usability.Price/Bang for buck factor:With the above listed specs, I was able to get the 64GB Ion Gold variant for about $325 right here on Amazon with free two-day Prime shipping. In comparison the Nexus 6P is running about $550 USD here on Amazon (although I have seen it on sale on the Egg for $500 for the Gold variant previously but still have to pay shipping sometimes). Likewise the Oneplus Two has just recently been reduced to $350 for the 64GB variant, but you have to pay shipping). Anyway, you will be hard pressed to find a phone with these specs for this price and if you don't need the 64GB storage internal, you can always opt for the 32GB version which is now running for about $300 as of this writing.Performance:Since I have fired this thing up, it connected right away (although I had to manually set the APN settings to get proper data connectivity) with Family Mobile (T-Mobile MVNO). Signal has been overall clear and call quality good. Even with many apps open, this thing doesn't miss a beat. No stutters, hangs or crashes. No overheating issues that I could detect (although it did feel a little warm upon first start up, after first update no more warmness). Battery life can sometimes leave something to be desired on moderate use, but once updated to Android Marshmallow 6.0 and one change to WiFi settings (set to Turn off when Asleep), battery life has gotten much better and I can make it through the day until the evening one one charge even with some moderate use (web surfing, streaming music and some playing games). This is even if I unplug the phone off the charger the evening before instead of the morning of. Again battery still leaves something to be desired, but it can be expected somewhat due to a large 1440p display and a powerful chip powering this thing. Also, even when battery life is depleted due to heavy use it is offset by having Quick Charge feature when using the supplied wall charger. I found from testing the provided wall charger will get the phone from 10% to 80~85% within 60 minutes, dependent on the features I have turned on in the background (Wi-Fi, etc.). I neglected to mention that in my original review, but a commenter mentioned it (thanks BTW!) and I wanted to add the extra info. Close to stock Android interface and not much pre-installed bloat ensures this thing runs smooth. Driving across from Las Vegas to Utah this thing maintained overall constant connectivity and data streaming with music for most of the whole trip, although there was a brief second when switching frequencies that the phone dropped connectivity and when I had one small dead zone the phone took a while to reconnect. I don't know if this is normal or a cause for concern and if so, then I will return. The good news is there is a 2-year warranty if the phone stops working then they will repair or replace at no cost to me for extended coverage. If within 35 days of purchase it is defective, I can get a full refund which is a comfort. If within 30 days I have buyer's remorse over purchasing this phone, I can get a refund but I have to pay the cost of shipping. It's a peace of mind that helps when purchasing this device and adds value to the purchase. Unless something goes wrong with it, I don't see myself returning it.Design:The Axon ZTE Pro has a premium look and feel that is comparable to the Nexus 6P. It has a slightly raised glass finish on the front and grill design on the top ear piece area and down on the single speaker (which is actually quite powerful sounding). The back has simple lines and design with an Axon logo. It comes in 3 colors, which is a Gold (my model), Blue (although it's very dark colored) and a Silver. I probably would have chose the Pthalo Blue or Silver if they'd been in stock, but the gold is actually quite nice to look at once you see it. The rear has dual lens camera that works actually really well and has a fast shutter speed. I was able to get some really good pics with it and my inner shutterbug started to come out while I was down on the Vegas strip. Still hard to catch one of my sons in motion, but he's like a humming bird with how fast he moves. There is also a dual flash on the back, but I haven't had to use it in auto mode. The biggest shame is covering this thing in the hybrid armor case I purchased for this kind of covered up the neat design of the phone. Lots of internal storage for taking pictures and downloading music, but bear in mind there isn't any expandable storage which is one reason I bought the 64GB variant. If you save most of your stuff to the cloud the limitation of storage isn't much of an issue.Well, this review is getting longer than I expected and it's getting late but just to wrap up, this is a budget flagship that will go toe-to-toe with the best of them and comes out in the top three or so devices. If you give it a chance, you will find there's a great phone to be had here for not a lot of coin. It makes a few compromises (no fingerprint scanner, no expandable storage, etc.) but if none of those are deal breakers than give it a try and you won't be sorry. I am glad I pulled the trigger on this phone and would recommend the same to a friend or someone else I know. I hope this phone and this company (ZTE) get a lot more attention and credit for what they've done here: a solid flagship phone at an affordable price with timely software updates, making a great daily driver.UPDATE 3/9/16:So after a week of use and a little more in-depth testing, a couple updates to some of the issues I was experiencing (or thought I was experiencing) and a weird random issue that happened today. First, regarding the belief that I was getting weak LTE signal compared to my wife's LG G Stylo (T-Mobile branded phone) on T-Mobiles network as comparing the cell phone signal status bar would show 1-2 bars on my LTE signal whereas hers would show 3-4 bars (of full bars). After doing some in depth testing/comparison within the native settings and within a free app called LTE Discovery (great app BTW), I found my signal strength was just as strong if not a little stronger than my wife's LG G Stylo. Upon refreshing network on both phones, my phone ranged from -107 to -104 dbm (lower is better) while my wife's phone was -107 to -106 dbm. As I said before, my data reception has been good as well as call quality data.Second, as time has gone on since the Android 6.0 and after turning Wi-Fi to turn off in sleep mode in the settings, my battery life has gotten even better and a full charge will last me not only all day but ~24 hours with light-moderate use and until the evening when using heavily or playing games. Light-moderate use includes web browsing, streaming music and watching Youtube videos. When playing intensive games during heavy use the battery goes much faster, but that's to be expected.Last random issue that just came up was what I thought was initially a malfunction, turned out to be after some research and reading the instruction manual was due to a dedicated camera button (that I was unaware of) being unexpectedly turned on while on the road due to my protective case and the phone mount where it was gripping said case. So if you are going to mount the phone in a phone clip keep the area clear where the dedicated camera button is (bottom right button below power button). As I use this phone more, I am really coming to like it even more! If it had external SD (can't complain with 64GB internal storage though) and double-tap to wake (can be fixed with update ZTE!) this would be the perfect phone!UPDATES 2 & 3 3/24/16: After some lengthy road trips and torture testing, with constant screen awake, Google Maps running with GPS location on, and streaming music over LTE data I average over 3.5+ hours total screen-on time. If I charge it the evening before and take off charger around 8PM, battery will last me until 4-5 PM (towards end of work day) on a single charge with web browsing, music streaming, etc.After recently switching to T-Mobile post-paid, I can confirm personally VoLTE is working on voice calls! I made a couple calls while on 4G LTE and signal remained on 4G LTE while calling and during voice call whereas before on Walmart Family Mobile, it would switch to HSPA+ during call and then back to 4G LTE afterwards (this also leads me to believe T-Mo is at least testing Band 12 in my area). Also, if you aren't a tech geek like me and don't know why you should care, let me just say calls on VoLTE are super clear and sound amazing! They also come thru louder as well as clearer. I was calling someone from outside and the person was inside a building and it sounded like I was right next to the person. Also, tried Wi-Fi calling and texting and even on a mediocre hotel Wi-Fi hot-spot call quality sounded pretty good. Texts can be sent on Wi-Fi as well. This was not supported on Family Mobile, but is on T-Mo postpaid so keep that in mind. As I use this phone more, I keep finding new features and things that make owning this phone even more awesome. Also if you are on T-Mobile post-paid and are looking for an affordable flagship phone that takes advantage of all the advantages the carrier provides (Band 12 extended range LTE, VoLTE support, CA Band support, Wi-Fi calling/texting, etc.) getting this phone is a no-brainer!NOTE: Screenshot I uploaded was only edited to remove the personal information of the phone number, but this is an actual screenshot from my ZTE Axon Pro while on a voice call showing still on 4G LTE.

I found from testing the provided wall charger will get the phone from 10% to 80~85% within 60 minutes, dependent on the features I have turned on in the background (Wi-Fi, etc.). I neglected to mention that in my original review, but a commenter mentioned it (thanks BTW!) and I wanted to add the extra info. Close to stock Android interface and not much pre-installed bloat ensures this thing runs smooth. Driving across from Las Vegas to Utah this thing maintained overall constant connectivity and data streaming with music for most of the whole trip, although there was a brief second when switching frequencies that the phone dropped connectivity and when I had one small dead zone the phone took a while to reconnect. I don't know if this is normal or a cause for concern and if so, then I will return. The good news is there is a 2-year warranty if the phone stops working then they will repair or replace at no cost to me for extended coverage. If within 35 days of purchase it is defective, I can get a full refund which is a comfort. If within 30 days I have buyer's remorse over purchasing this phone, I can get a refund but I have to pay the cost of shipping. It's a peace of mind that helps when purchasing this device and adds value to the purchase. Unless something goes wrong with it, I don't see myself returning it.Design:The Axon ZTE Pro has a premium look and feel that is comparable to the Nexus 6P. It has a slightly raised glass finish on the front and grill design on the top ear piece area and down on the single speaker (which is actually quite powerful sounding). The back has simple lines and design with an Axon logo. It comes in 3 colors, which is a Gold (my model), Blue (although it's very dark colored) and a Silver. I probably would have chose the Pthalo Blue or Silver if they'd been in stock, but the gold is actually quite nice to look at once you see it. The rear has dual lens camera that works actually really well and has a fast shutter speed. I was able to get some really good pics with it and my inner shutterbug started to come out while I was down on the Vegas strip. Still hard to catch one of my sons in motion, but he's like a humming bird with how fast he moves. There is also a dual flash on the back, but I haven't had to use it in auto mode. The biggest shame is covering this thing in the hybrid armor case I purchased for this kind of covered up the neat design of the phone. Lots of internal storage for taking pictures and downloading music, but bear in mind there isn't any expandable storage which is one reason I bought the 64GB variant. If you save most of your stuff to the cloud the limitation of storage isn't much of an issue.Well, this review is getting longer than I expected and it's getting late but just to wrap up, this is a budget flagship that will go toe-to-toe with the best of them and comes out in the top three or so devices. If you give it a chance, you will find there's a great phone to be had here for not a lot of coin. It makes a few compromises (no fingerprint scanner, no expandable storage, etc.) but if none of those are deal breakers than give it a try and you won't be sorry. I am glad I pulled the trigger on this phone and would recommend the same to a friend or someone else I know. I hope this phone and this company (ZTE) get a lot more attention and credit for what they've done here: a solid flagship phone at an affordable price with timely software updates, making a great daily driver.UPDATE 3/9/16:So after a week of use and a little more in-depth testing, a couple updates to some of the issues I was experiencing (or thought I was experiencing) and a weird random issue that happened today. First, regarding the belief that I was getting weak LTE signal compared to my wife's LG G Stylo (T-Mobile branded phone) on T-Mobiles network as comparing the cell phone signal status bar would show 1-2 bars on my LTE signal whereas hers would show 3-4 bars (of full bars). After doing some in depth testing/comparison within the native settings and within a free app called LTE Discovery (great app BTW), I found my signal strength was just as strong if not a little stronger than my wife's LG G Stylo. Upon refreshing network on both phones, my phone ranged from -107 to -104 dbm (lower is better) while my wife's phone was -107 to -106 dbm. As I said before, my data reception has been good as well as call quality data.Second, as time has gone on since the Android 6.0 and after turning Wi-Fi to turn off in sleep mode in the settings, my battery life has gotten even better and a full charge will last me not only all day but ~24 hours with light-moderate use and until the evening when using heavily or playing games. Light-moderate use includes web browsing, streaming music and watching Youtube videos. When playing intensive games during heavy use the battery goes much faster, but that's to be expected.Last random issue that just came up was what I thought was initially a malfunction, turned out to be after some research and reading the instruction manual was due to a dedicated camera button (that I was unaware of) being unexpectedly turned on while on the road due to my protective case and the phone mount where it was gripping said case. So if you are going to mount the phone in a phone clip keep the area clear where the dedicated camera button is (bottom right button below power button). As I use this phone more, I am really coming to like it even more! If it had external SD (can't complain with 64GB internal storage though) and double-tap to wake (can be fixed with update ZTE!) this would be the perfect phone!UPDATES 2 & 3 3/24/16: After some lengthy road trips and torture testing, with constant screen awake, Google Maps running with GPS location on, and streaming music over LTE data I average over 3.5+ hours total screen-on time. If I charge it the evening before and take off charger around 8PM, battery will last me until 4-5 PM (towards end of work day) on a single charge with web browsing, music streaming, etc.After recently switching to T-Mobile post-paid, I can confirm personally VoLTE is working on voice calls! I made a couple calls while on 4G LTE and signal remained on 4G LTE while calling and during voice call whereas before on Walmart Family Mobile, it would switch to HSPA+ during call and then back to 4G LTE afterwards (this also leads me to believe T-Mo is at least testing Band 12 in my area). Also, if you aren't a tech geek like me and don't know why you should care, let me just say calls on VoLTE are super clear and sound amazing! They also come thru louder as well as clearer. I was calling someone from outside and the person was inside a building and it sounded like I was right next to the person. Also, tried Wi-Fi calling and texting and even on a mediocre hotel Wi-Fi hot-spot call quality sounded pretty good. Texts can be sent on Wi-Fi as well. This was not supported on Family Mobile, but is on T-Mo postpaid so keep that in mind. As I use this phone more, I keep finding new features and things that make owning this phone even more awesome. Also if you are on T-Mobile post-paid and are looking for an affordable flagship phone that takes advantage of all the advantages the carrier provides (Band 12 extended range LTE, VoLTE support, CA Band support, Wi-Fi calling/texting, etc.) getting this phone is a no-brainer!NOTE: Screenshot I uploaded was only edited to remove the personal information of the phone number, but this is an actual screenshot from my ZTE Axon Pro while on a voice call showing still on 4G LTE. Again, if VoLTE wasn't active it will switch to 4G (HSPA+) signal.","56","helpful"
"ZTE Axon 7 unlocked smartphone,64GB Grey (US Warranty)","ZTE","399.99","5","┬áNote: The video was made on the day I received the device. The written review was made after a week of use, so the in-depth written review may be more helpful for most people.The ZTE Axon 7 could be the 2nd flagship killer of the year, following on the heels of the release of the OnePlus 3. So the question is, does the Axon 7 live up to its $400 price tag, and the quick answer is an emphatic ΓÇ£YES,ΓÇ¥ it probably could easily be mistaken by the average consumer as a $600 phone, but the Axon 7 is not without its faults. Here are my thoughts on the phone after one full week of usage:Build Quality: 4.5/5 - From the outset, this phone screams premium. The all metal unibody design from ZTE looks absolutely stunning. The rounded sides and relatively thin bezels give this phone with a 5.5ΓÇ¥ screen a smaller footprint than the average 5.5ΓÇ¥ phone. The only complaint I have with the build quality is how slippery the metal backing feels in the hand, which is why it is appreciated that ZTE included a thin clear TPU case in the box that gives it a less slippery feel.Screen Quality: 4.8/5 - The screen on the Axon 7 is a 5.5ΓÇ¥ AMOLED 2K display. It is bright enough to see in the brightest days, and dim enough to watch Netflix in the dark without hurting your eyes.Performance: 5/5 - The Axon 7 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor combined with the Adreno 530 GPU chipset and 4GB of RAM. This combination allows the ZTE to fly through any process that you through at it. Gaming, social networking, YouTube, and any other app that you throw at the Axon 7 will run buttery smooth. The only time that IΓÇÖve had any slow downs is when apps were being downloaded in the background and I was trying use other heavy apps like Madden Mobile at that the same time.Cameras: 4.5/5 - The 20MP camera on the back is a very solid camera. Is it the best camera IΓÇÖve used on a cell phoneΓÇª no, but it does hold its own against many of the top flagship cameras. Where the ZTE sometimes falls short is in low light performance. It actually takes relatively good pictures in low light, but it defaults to low light HDR and Night Mode a little too often (both of which cause the shutter speed to slow down). The 8MP front facing selfie camera is a wide angle camera that takes excellent photos in good lighting, and decent photos in low light. It should be noted that there is no front facing flash, but this certainly isnΓÇÖt a deal breaker for me.Speakers: 4.8/5 - The front facing speakers on the Axon 7 are definitely among the best in the business. Will they replace your Bluetooth speaker, no, but they certainly are better than the speakers on any other flagship phone of 2016 (including the HTC 10). The sound clarity is on point, and the listening experience is pleasant. It is really just difficult to beat a pair of front facing speakers on a phone, especially when they have the output of the Axon 7. It should also be noted that ZTE did also include special Dolby audio drivers in the phone to give high quality sound output through the headphones as well. Personally I havenΓÇÖt noticed a huge difference in the audio quality when compared to other high end phones, but I am also not an audiophile either.Battery Life: 4/5 - The Axon 7 comes with a 3250 mAh battery which will get the average user through a day of use with some battery to spare. Personally, as a heavy user that likes to push phones to their limits with all the antennas running, 20+ apps running in the background, and screen brightness turned up to around 50% most of the time, I could get through around 9pm before needing to get a quick fill up. So far I have been averaging right around 4 hours of screen on time, which is pretty much on par with just about every other flagship phone from 2016. Thankfully ZTE included Qualcomm 3.0 Quick Charging in the Axon 7, and even included a Qualcomm 3.0 charging block in the box as well.Connectivity: 5/5 - The Axon 7 works with all 4 major carriers in the U.S. So far my signal strength with Cricket Wireless on the Axon 7 has been just as good as any other phone that IΓÇÖve used in 2016. The wifi signal may be the best that IΓÇÖve had of any phone this year. In areas of my house where I would only get one or two bars of wifi signal with other phones, on the ZTE I am getting closer to 3 or 4 bars of signal.The Fingerprint Scanner: 4.8/5 - The fingerprint scanner in my use has been about 90% accurate. That is to say that about 9 times out of 10 it will work on the first try. Personally my preference is for a scanner on the front, but I will sacrifice having the scanner on the back if that means I get dual front facing speakers. The response time of the Axon 7 fingerprint scanner is also very quick.The Extras: 5/5 - With the ZTE Axon 7 you really can get away with just making the $400 purchase and not ever purchasing another accessory for it. In the box you get a clear TPU case, a plastic screen protector, a Qualcomm 3.0 charging block, a USB Type-C charging cable, a pair of ZTE headphones, and a sim removal tool.Conclusion: The ZTE Axon 7 makes me question why anyone would pay $600 plus dollars for a flagship phone that is locked to a particular carrier. I really believe that this phone is just as good, if not better than many of the ΓÇ£flagshipΓÇ¥ phones out there. ItΓÇÖs not a perfect phone, but it is definitely worth your $400.","171","helpful"
"ZTE Axon 7 unlocked smartphone,64GB Grey (US Warranty)","ZTE","399.99","4","After playing around with it last few hours here are my initial impressions of the ZTE Axon 7 ( i put in a 64gb mircoSD card in it)- It comes in a medium sized box containing quite a few things (Clear plastic case,earbuds,removal tool)-remember the Axon 7 charges via USB Type C instead of micro USB. (ZTE provides an additional addon adapter for micro usb users besides the 3.0 certified charger)- After putting in a TMo sim card ,i did notice...the processor (820) was quick & snappy.It flowed quite easily even when i was downloading all my apps onto it....though it did get a tad bit warm.-Now looks wise...its a sexy smartphone. Metal body with a gold tinge to it....fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone.Looks very high end.(Btw...it also lets you add in a pin or pattern code just in case your fingerprints dont work.)- For those complaining of Brightness issues...you can tweek that in settings...uncheck automatic and adjust it yourself. It has a 5.5-inch, 2540 x 1400 display. Very color-accurate.-It has dual front end speakers ( for you HiFi audiophiles. The Axon 7 sports dual Hi-Fi audio chips) i tried out a few Youtube videos...and yes its quite clear & loud. ( I haven't had time to test the headphone jack or give it a real music test...but so far it sounds better than my old +1)Performance wise:The 820 processor was excellent. i downloaded a few games (Lunar mission,Mortal Kombat X,Pacman,SSg3) Everything went very smooth...not stutter nor a glitch.Played a few YouTube videos...watched Kodi for 2 hours straight...and it didn't even get warm.Camera-It comes with a 20 mp camera on the back...8mp on the front.Since it was dark & rainy today...i only took a few shots where it seems it struggles a little in lowlight situations. ( im testing out a camera app (Snap Camera) to see if it improves this in the next few days)Heres a few pictures though as you see....not bad at all.Pretty good but not greatBattery wise...so far it's not bad after solid use for 3 hrs it dropped to 70%, which isn't bad...nor great. Once i cycle through it a few times...i'll know more about it.( if any major issues ill post it up)Memory;It comes with 4gb RAM & 64gb with an added slot for either additional memory (i used a 64gb microSd card to pump it up to 128gb) or an additional sim card for those who travel alot ( or you shady MoFos who use two #s)This one thing by itself made me choose the ZTE Axon 7 over the OPO +3....additional memory comes in handy when taking hi quality pictures or 4k video (which yes this phone can do ).Being a parent of two young kids,you definitely don't need to start running out of memory quick on any phone.Sorry Oneplus...but this was a big mistake on your part.Overall :Im giving it a 4.25/5 stars (can't with this rating system) without really testing headphone audio & the camera (in better weather)...so it might improve or stay as is.It's a solid smartphone...looks great...works great...sounds (so far) awesome.It's a feature rich smartphone which will improve with software updatesYou can't go wrong for 400 bucks...and yes this phone just took OPO's Flagship Killer title away from it...It just earned it...btw here are default apps im using ...just in case anyone wants to know.Launcher- i used the ""stock android"" one it comes with...why you ask?It lets me have an app drawer which the MiFavor does not.(it comes with 2 choices (Stock Android + MiFavor)Dialer - DW Dailer/Truecaller (DW Dailer is great for those who drive alot...Big icons/TrueCaller to see who's calling you.)Gallery- ToolWiz photosMusic- BlackPlayer ( but i'll test out the default one as well in the next few days)Video (update: watching videos i use VLC/Snap camera's video to record video)Camera- Snap CameraBrowser- ChromeEmail- InboxUpdate (8-21)Here's a solution to a popular problem for those of you who have the ZTE Axon 7.How to save my pictures & videos on my SD Card1. Open the Camera app.2. press the settings option in the upper left corner3. press ""save location""4. Press ""saving location setting""5. select SD card.Viola!Now you can save your pictures & video on your MicroSD Card. (i've seen this as a major issue with a few people)Now that it's been almost a month since i've had this phone...here's a few more impressions about it.(and i added 2 more pictures & 1 screenshot)Camera- Snap Camera works incredible with this phone,though not on that top tier of smartphone cameras...this app lets you take advantage of the 20mp camera.Will every picture look great? No but it does a great job nonethelessVideo - I've tried out Snap Cameras video app to record video, it's decent.VLC though with the Dolby sound ...works great in downloaded videos.-I've had no glitches with this phone at all...Just getting a great screen cover is my only issue (Tried skinomi. Hated it...kept bubbling up)-Id suggest everyone buy a spare usb C charger ...heres what i got.AUKEY PA-T9 USB Wall Charger with Quick Charge 3.0 for Galaxy S7/S6/Edge, Nexus 6p, LG G5 (Qualcomm Certified)USB Type C Cable, Skyocean┬« Type C to USB 3.0 3.3Ft/1M Braided Cable for Nexus 6P, 5X, OnePlus 2, Nokia N1 Tablet and Other USB type C Devices with a Free cable organizerSpending an extra 20 bucks for a spare was worthwhile if i lost my original ZTE charger & cord....i use these at my house.If any other questions...feel free to ask.","350","helpful"
"ZTE Axon 7 Mini - Factory Unlocked Phone - (Platinum Grey)","ZTE(USA) Wireless","299.98","3","Device supports VoLTE with an upgrade to the software, however does not support T-Mobile's VoLTE implementation. This means calls are placed off HSPA or GSM depending on what's available in the area. As I do not have a AT&T or VZW SIM card to test, I can't see if VoLTE works on them either. Based off that, I can't recommend this device for T-Mobile, WalMart Family Mobile, Metro PCS, Brighthouse (Target), Ultra Mobile, GoSmart, or Simple Mobile.The device does have 2 SIM card slots. However, if you would like to use both SIM cards, you will lose the SD Card slot.Make no mistake, the device functions, but not having VoLTE for T-Mobile (as that is my carrier) means this device is not going to work for me.","14","helpful"

The fact that it has 16GB of space and 1.5GB of RAM makes it really worth the money when compared to other phones in this price range (most have 8GB of space or only 1GB of RAM).

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","Alcatel","292.98","4","Have only owned it for about a week. Battery saver is excellent for me but if you're walking around with the phone in your pocket, it will detect motion and may not sleep as you might expect. Mine sits on a table much of the day and so it sleeps soundly. :-) Speakers are nice JBL but bass response is still lacking which is inherent in the extremely thin design of this phone. You may need to install an equalizer to reduce mid and high frequencies for a richer sound. I would have given 5 stars except that there is a small ""sweet spot"" when listening on a phone call. If the phone is not placed just so on the ear, the volume is reduced significantly. I think it just takes some practice. The dual speakers and dual microphones work beautifully for quickly answering phone upside down if necessary. FM radio will not run unless earphones are plugged in as they act as an antenna. Display is perfect for me. Some built in wallpapers look pixelated but they're probably just crappy samples. As you'll see with Android 5, you cannot have a different wallpaper on your lock screen. So much for using it as a quick flashlight like I did with my old phone.Android 5 does come with a flashlight hidden in the SECOND pull-down notification menu with the Bluetooth and WiFi buttons. The flashlight is not an ""app"". Note: WiFi does NOT turn on using the ""WiFi Display"" app. You must use either the settings menu or the second pull down menu to do that. This phone has an auto-dimming screen which also automatically brightens to max when in sunlight. VERY nice feature but you may find that a nearby light source in a dark room could fool the sensor and make it dimmer than you want it. Just adjust the angle of the screen so that the sensor detects the light and the screen will brighten accordingly. You can also turn this feature off.This is not a ""department store"" brand. They are sold at T-Mobile stores and I was told by a clerk that the Idol 3 is really nice and they don't have it to sell because they were sent a lesser version by corporate.Almost forgot to mention the most important thing; This phone is an upgrade from my 3 year old Samsung which was loading pages agonizingly slow. This Alcatel with Android 5 and LTE loads pages almost instantly! AND this phone is eligible for the Android 6 Marshmallow upgrade as soon as it is available. No luck yet trying to upgrade but I love it! Marshmallow will allow you to override permissions for each app. Other than that, not much change.If you sign up for an Amazon Signature card like I did, you can get an extra $50. off this phone. BEWARE: Amazon automatically changes your default payment method to the new card! If you don't want that, go to your settings and change it back to your old card. Also, the phone must be purchased with the Amazon card to get the discount. So remember to pay off the card right away if you don't want interest charged. You have 21 days grace period. I've had this card before. Keep an eye on your default payment before you check out because it was changed on me once before without my knowledge before making a purchase. One-click ordering is what caused it to happen to me as it does not give you an opportunity to see your default payment method.","1","helpful"

I get hi fps on Riptide GP 2 on high settings, and most other games and 360 video work well. If you really want an immersive experience with a small price tag, this is the phone I would recommend. Oh btw, update to Android 6 before you activate a service plan. I had to tweak APN settings after the update to keep using the phone service. It's just less hassle. Had it for a month and i love it.","1","helpful"

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","Alcatel","292.98","5","I'm really happy with this phone. It is packed to the brim with features, has a very modern Android (it updated to 6.0 right after I unpacked it and connected it), has tons of storage space (I added an 32 GB SD card, so I now have about 45 GB of free space to store applications and data - thank's to Android 6's ""emulated storage"" built-in feature). It looks beautiful, has the perfect size (4.7"" is not too small, but also not too large), and the speakers sound great. People are genuinely impressed when I show them my new phone, and even more so when I tell them how little I paid for it - this is definitely NOT one of the crappy half-functioning super-cheap phones - this phone is a rare combination of being great and cheap.","1","helpful"
"ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.5 Display, 8GB (GSM - US Warranty)","Alcatel","79.95","3","The phone I received is model number 5017O-2AALUS1, which meets the description of the ""Global"" Pixie 3 4.5"" -- with one notable exception: It has 4.28GB of total memory, not 8GB.I'm including screen shots from ""Settings-Storage"" and ""Settings--About Phone"" which show the model number and actual memory of my phone. This was a disappointment since I need and expected 8GB. I have since tried without success to find a Pixi 3 4.5"" with 8GB of memory.While it is too limited to be my primary phone at home, I am keeping it to use while traveling in Europe. In addition to the 4G LTE frequencies used by AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM operators on this side of the pond, it has the primary European 4G LTE frequency. My home phone does not.On the whole, this is a suitable phone for beginners, those on a budget, and anyone who doesn't need enough memory to run a lot of apps. The screen resolution is less than on more expensive models, which means text and images appear larger. On a 4.5-inch screen, that's a nice benefit for people like me who are a tad hard of seeing.","1","helpful"

"ASUS ZenFone2 Unlocked Smartphone, 16GB, 4GB RAM, Black - ZE551ML (U.S. Warranty)","Asus","168.34","3","Was looking for a more affordable smart phone so I bought this phone because the specs looked really promising. I've used Moto G in the past and thought with this phone's specs, it wouldn't hurt to try an Asus phone, boy was I wrong. First off this phone comes jammed packed with Asus apps, apps that you cannot remove and apps that takes up precious memory space. This phone also prompts you to download software upgrades, one after another. One would think these upgrades would make your phone a bit more advance and usable, but these upgrades only makes your phone slower and eventually leads your phone into a bigger issue, one that creates a flickering screen, a vertical band that causes the user unable to unlock the phone. If you're lucky enough, where your phone still falls under the manufacturer warranty, you can call or chat online with an Asus rep and they're issue you a RMA. With a $25 charge, they will issue you a certified refurbished phone--no guarantee if it's a previously NIB defective phone, or an old phone that user with similar issues like me sent back. It's something you'll have to gamble with. Since they do not have a walk in center, all of this will have to be done via mail. Or, of you can go without a phone, you can send it back in for a fix, and it saves you the $25. When you're already frustrated because you have a phone that does not work, you'll have to prolong your wait for a phone replacement. This is my first experience with an Asus phone, needless to say, it would be my last.","1","helpful"

"BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- Global GSM Unlocked - Grey","BLU","139","5","So the Young Steffy Bee was in the market for a phone, I was using a Blackberry Q10 for a few months and while it was pretty deent, I needed apps to text all the ratchet women I talk to who use various methods of contact (Instagram,Whatsapp,Kik) so I had to venture over to the android world and that is how I ran across the BLU Energy X Plus. At first I was kind of skeptical because I have never heard of a BLU but I took the leap of faith and I am glad I did!! First of all beloveds, the batter life is EXCELLENT, usually no matter how good a phone boats on battery life, I can never get a charge for more than half a day, but with this BLU Energy X, with med-low brightness I am on all day at minimum with moderate-heavy use (Youtube, downloading music,Hearthstone - Dont tell anybody I play this, etc)To me the phone has decent build/spec quality, glass front-aluminum/alloy back, speakers are back facing pretty much all the hoopla you can read in the product description, but there are a few quirks....Non removable battery - This has never been a issue for me especially because I never carried multiple batteries, and with the size of this battery you wouldn't need to unless there was a defect.Phone Case- I almost threw away the box right after I got the phone, but upon further review there was a clear plastic gel case that comes with the phone that I thought was really dope as most companies even package headphones anymoreHeadphones- Not really much to say on these as I did not use them very much but they are in ear standard headphones w/ in line mic. The quality is not amazing but getting headphones with phones is rare in itself so this is definitely a plusMicro SD Card tray - BLU WHY!!!!! this is probably the worst design flaw that this phone has in my opinion which again in hindsight is probably not even that big of an issue for most, but annoys me. The SD card slot is a tray that you have to open by putting the Pin inside (it comes with the device) to push the tray out instead of the other method of you just pushing the SD card in and out with a dust cover keep the card from being exposed, which makes it pretty cumbersome if you swap SD cards a lot or do not have a pin that can fit in the slot handy at the time of you getting the new Micro SD card.Software-I am 80% sure this is not stock android as the purists use but it works perfectly fine with no real bloatware besides the Amazon suite of apps (Kindle,Appstore,Amazon) and a theme store. I notice no lag on my end when using the device and it loads all of my apps with no stutter. Also if you use the Music Player you can scratch your records like a DJ to seek between the song, which I find my self playing with that more times then most in random situations.All in all this is a great phone and is a no brainer at ~$100.Steffy Bee out.","1","helpful"

Firstly the phone I got only has 8GB of storage. With this phone not being able to use an SD card this is very aggravating. But I'm not gonna blow a lid over it. I just think that I should've gotten what I paid for. Second, this phone is outdated but that's not so bad, what is however, is that right out the box you can barely use the phone. Due to an update of Microsoft's security certificates this phone can't sign into either Google nor... wait for it.... Microsoft. So no apps, no contacts, email, nothing.

"Sprint HTC 6800 Mogul Good Condition Pocket PC Phone","HTC","21.99","2","Like many others, my ""upgrade"" wasn't available yet, so I searched for a cheap, functioning phone to tie me over until then. While I miss my android phone dearly, this one gets the job done for now. -Email, text, navigation, web browser. No apps or anything like that, but hey, it works. The one I bought from here was a refurbished model, which probably explains why I have the previous owner's text messages. -Even after I had the phone activated with my existing number, I still have the old owner's texts. Also, the battery isn't that great. I used the navigation for 15 min, and the battery died, after being fully charged prior. Definitely need it hooked into a car charger, if you're using the navigation.Overall, it IS pretty old school, in comparison to all the android and smart phones nowadays, but it's good enough to hold you over until you can upgrade with your cell provider.**Updated 5/24/14For a short while, this phone worked great. -No major issues, other than it being pretty old, and the battery issue. :) Unfortunately, that was short-lived. It constantly freezes up, both during use and while starting up/turning on. I've been out in public, and had to remove the battery to restart, then wait another 10 minutes for it to turn ON, and when it finally does, the battery is mysteriously nearly dead. Would I still recommend? Yeah, probably, if you're seeking a super cheap phone for a very brief period of time. Fortunately for me, my free/inexpensive upgrade is due in a week. Otherwise, I would absolutely NOT recommend using this phone long-term.","1","helpful"

The music player is easy to navigate and just as simple to use as an iPod. The camera/camcorder are clear. The touch keyboard is responsive and doesn't require a hard press to get the letter up. Conversation style texting is an added bonus. Audio clarity is excellent. All in all this is the best phone that I have ever owned.

"HTC Touch Pro Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, Windows Mobile 6.1, Wi-Fi, GPS, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with No Warranty (Black)","HTC America","189","1","The phone is visually appealing and has a nice feature set, e.g. ability to edit excel and MS Word files. The software and firmware a poorly executed however. As an example, if you use the phone in a corporate environment and are calling a number with an automated answering service (or even just retrieving your voicemail), the process is as follows to press 1 for english or retrieve your voicemail. Pull the phone away from your head, press the button on the top to turn the screen back on, type in your 4 digit security code to unlock the screen, press the enter button with a stylus at the bottom, press the 1 or 7 or whatever you were after. Conversely an iPhone has a photosensor that recognizes the phone is not attached to your head so it is a 1 step process.The phone locks up regularly requiring a battery removal reboot. It is a nice idea and by the specs it ahould bw a good phone. In practice it is very poorly executed. There are many work mates that have discarded these phones so there should be a robust used market. I would not buy another HTC phone unless there was some dramatic change in their software/firmware.","1","helpful"
"HTC Wildfire A3333 Unlocked GSM SmartPhone with Android OS, 5 MP Camera, Wi-Fi, and Touch Screen--International Version with No US Warranty (Black)","HTC America","104.56","1","I did lots of research before purchasing this phone, and I was pleased with the bang for the buck when the phone arrived. Then I noticed that the Android Market was missing. The ability to add apps was my number one reason for selecting an android phone. I'm pretty tech savvy, and I invested a few hours looking into resolving the problem on my own, but found no easy way. Like other reviewers with the same issue, I had the Arabic version.In summary, I recommend the phone if you're looking for a low cost, entry level smartphone. Yes, the resolution is poor, but it's OK given the price tag. Yes, the phone can be sluggish at times, but it's not excessive and I could easily live with it. However, if you do decide on this phone, I highly recommend asking the seller if it's the Arabic version and if the Android Market app is installed.Also, keep in mind that the Wildfire S will be coming out shortly, and will have a slightly better processor and screen resolution. Of course, it will also be more expensive...","1","helpful"

Very happy I got this instead of the newest iPhone or Samsung for $700. Solid phone. Mine came with a screen saver which is now about at the end of it's life. I use this phone in the field for a highway contractor so it sees plenty of dust and has been dropped at least a dozen times.Placed a tone of music on 32 GB SD Card. If I skip songs it might lag for a few seconds but that has more to do with the card being too full. The storage manager pops up and I clean off the junk and the music player works fine. The FM radio is awesome although I really don't use it often it's nice to have if there were a major earthquake or something else that could take out cell service. Battery lasts over a day for me put I really don't use it much at work. The camera is awesome, might not be as good as the latest iPhone but I saved $500. Camera has a professional setting which you can change the exposure, white balance., etc. The pictures look great on social media posts.","1","helpful"
"Honor 5X Unlocked Smartphone, 16GB Dark Grey (US Warranty)","Huawei","199.99","5","I bought this phone back in October to replace my HTC One M9. The battery was failing on it and was draining from 100 all the way to zero within 6 hours even while in airplane mode and wifi turned off and with minimal usage. I went to get a new phone from ATT via the upgrade options only to discover I couldn't upgrade until April of next year. And so I went to Amazon, and decided I wanted a an unlocked phone with dual sim card slots as well as an sd card slot that was fast, with a good camera, and had a decent amount of onboard storage. That's when I found the Honor 5X from Huawei, a company I'd never heard of before. It had the specs of a flagship phone at half half the price of one and just $200. I was very sceptical at first, but with the money I had there weren't any other phones in the price range I could afford that I liked. I took the chance and ordered it, and fell in love with it as soon as I turned it on. It is everything it was advertised to be. The one and only gripe I have with it is it only has 2GB or RAM (I would have preferred 3GB or more), but even with this little RAM, the phone is fast enough for me, and so I can live with it. I would definitely reccomend this phone to others!","1","helpful"

"Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty","Huawei","399.99","3","After going through 3x LG G-series phones in as many years due to lousy build quality (bad touchscreen, screen detachment, bad motherboard/boot loop issues), I decided to abandon the brand. As a consumer, I prize build quality, durability, intuitive controls, and bang for your buck. To put things in perspective, my favorite all-time smartphone design is the Motorola Defy: it was built like a tank and worked underwater; it was rugged--you could drop it and it would barely scratch (no need for a phone case); had minimal bloat-wear; and served perfectly as an Every Day Carry (EDC) workhorse. Unfortunately, due to the current marketing strategy for cell phones, phones like the Defy are unicorns: the market currently is littered with disposable consumer goods built to be glass houses so manufacturers can increase profit. This led to a frustrating search high and low for a mid-tier phone that had good reviews with a decent camera; good build quality; impressive specs for the money; and a solid User Interface (UI) experience. That is, until I came across Huawei, and the Honor 8.Professional and amateur reviews I found were nearly universally positive, pointing to a beautiful body design; good customer support; good camera; good specs, and compatibility with T-MobileΓÇÖs 12 band (a lot of other Chinese-made, and international-version phones donΓÇÖt support 12 band). I started leaning towards purchasing an Honor 8 (U.S. Warranty), but the one thing that held me back were the divisive ΓÇ£love it or leave itΓÇ¥ attitudes towards HuaweiΓÇÖs EMUI. Then, I heard they would be replacing EMUI 4.1 in the near future, and Amazon featured a deep discount on Black Friday for the phone (selling it under $300), so I pulled the trigger and made the purchase. IΓÇÖm about 2 weeks into using this phone, and while I want to love my Honor 8 as much as I did my Defy, Huawei's EMUI 4.1 greatly reduces my enjoyment and experience. This is why I deducted two stars, as EMUI is non-intuitive, and can be extremely frustrating when you miss notifications because of EMUI settings. If and when Huawei updates EMUI away from 4.1, I will give an updated review.Pros:+The phone is relatively slim, and great for one-handed operation.+The phone is fast. The screen unlocks as soon as you touch the fingerprint sensor, and I havenΓÇÖt experienced lag on any apps.+Battery life is really good. I can go through my commute and work day without having to charge my phone.+The camera is decent quality (minor lag at times when itΓÇÖs trying to focus), and has friendly controls. IΓÇÖve been spoiled by LGΓÇÖs cameras, but I feel the Honor 8 performs well.+Beautiful external design, but slippery. Definitely get a case for this phone if you donΓÇÖt want it sliding around.+Vibrant display, and transition times between dark/brightly lit rooms is good.+The phone will turn on WiFi to connect to a known network when youΓÇÖre in an area you frequent.Cons:-EMUI 4.1! EMUI 4.1!! EMUI 4.1!!!-Initial setup when switching from an old phone to the Honor 8 takes an extremely long time compared to stock Android. This is because EMUI has a bunch of settings you need to micromanage, ranging from app permissions, to notifications, to battery use. What I miss about LG is whenever I upgraded a phone, IΓÇÖd just connect the two phones via NFC and everything would sync up.-Settings continued: rather than having everything default to being enabled, you have to manually enable some settings. This means if youΓÇÖre not careful, some of your social media apps and email apps might not be protected by the Battery Manager. This means they wonΓÇÖt run when your phone is off, and you wonΓÇÖt get notifications. This was extremely frustrating on multiple occasions, especially when people were trying to contact me on messenger apps.-No app drawer. It took me a while to figure out how to add an app icon.-Speaker is loud enough, but sound quality is poor and really tinny.

It would be nice if the Honor 8 came with headphones, or an additional USB C-cable.-Other non-intuitive UI: When you slide down for Notifications, the Shortcuts (WiFi, Bluetooth, Flashlight, etc.) section needs to be clicked to access said menu. ItΓÇÖd be better to just have both Notifications and shortcuts combined on the same screen, like with stock Android.-IΓÇÖm unaware of any profile options: for example, if I want to turn off vibrate and reduce my notification/media/call sounds in the office, I have to play with the volume buttons each time, instead of clicking on a Profiles shortcut to select Home/Work/Outdoors.-Volume and Power (restart/shut down) options can only be accessed with the physical buttons. It would help with UI if we can just slide down to the Notification/Shortcuts menu and be able to digitally manipulate the settings. This would also reduce wear and tear on the physical keys, and let users continue to use the phone if the physical keys break.**If the options IΓÇÖve mentioned above are available with EMUI, it just goes to show how unintuitive the UI is. ThereΓÇÖs a lot to be desired in terms of intuitive controls, and I really hope Huawei will update EMUI as soon as possible.Final thoughts: The Honor 8 is a great phone that suffers from bad UI design. If EMUI were designed as beautifully as the Honor 8 phone itself, or were replaced with stock Android, I would not hesitate to recommend this phone to friends and family.

I can see why people pay much more for iphones because they like the IOS, but for people using Android, I don't see any reason why anyone would pay double/triple the price for a Samsung or Pixel phone. There is no way Samsung can compete for the price/quality. Samsung would only survive because of the carriers' protection.Now that carriers all ditched 2-year contracts, I can see Honor or some other cheap (but great) phones take over the Android market.Pros:- Beautiful design: I think it's even prettier than the Iphone- Fast: it may not have the fast CPU, but it's very fast for everything I use. No hiccups anywhere.- EMUI: some people don't like the UI on top of the stock Android. I think that's personal preferences. I happen to like the UI, lots of small but very useful features, good battery management tool. No App drawer similar to IOS, but I don't really care, just create folders to organize Apps. No complaints about the EMUI so far.- Battery: good side is that it's much better than my Samsung phone (even after I got a new battery for my Samsung). Good standby battery management. I tested it one night, during my 8 hours of sleep, battery dropped 3% from full charge. With normal usage, you can get 5-6 hours of screen on time.Cons:-Battery: I talked about the good side, but I wish the battery is 20% bigger. It's already a very thin and light phone, adding 20% battery wouldn't make it bulky, but it will go a long way. I played Pokemon once awhile (~45 mins total time), it can drain battery quickly. With Pokemon playing time, I only get about 4 and 1/2 hours total screen on time. Not too bad, but may not last me a day. Again, wish the battery was bigger.Overall, an amazing phone. To be fair in terms of battery cons, there are not many phones with large batteries nowadays. Iphones have good standby time, but if you play Pokemon, they are still not enough. I hope the phone makers make the phones slightly thicker with a bigger battery!","1","helpful"

The Honor 8 is a device that I highly recommend. It does not disappoint, and the value proposition is highly unexpected. I have absolutely no buyer's remorse. The one and only recommendation I'll leave you with is to BUY A CASE.

"Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Sapphire Blue - GSM - US Warranty","Huawei","399","5","So far this is the nicest phone I've owned. My second Huawei phone and the quality of their products has only gotten better imo. The design and build quality of this phone makes the jet black iphone look ordinary and the battery life makes the iphone look pathetic. I don't mind the EMUI that much, but am a real fan of Google Now, so went straight to that launcher. The settup was pretty easy, though it did not simply mirror my apps and settings from my other phone, so I had to download and install my favorite apps one at a time. Since the phone is so fast, that did not take much time and it gave me the chance to explore settings and features while I was doing the tasks. Camera results are superb though I have much more to learn about the options and features provided. Signal strength for both wifi and network are the best I've had in my rural local. So far I'm totally pleased with this item and found a case I really like, though I'd much rather use the phone without a case. That is not, however, a practical every day option. Drops could be fatal with so much glass exposed. I'll update more here if I change my point of view, but for now this is a winning choice for my needs and taste.","1","helpful"

"Huawei Ascend Mate 7 Factory Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, White","HUAWEI","299.99","4","I have to say, at first I was sceptical about this phone since its a company unknown to me, but now I would say this. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! I have to say that they did a fantastic job in making a 6 inch size phone display in a size that is almost the same length as the Iphone 6plus. Not only is it thin, but also has a great aluminium body that gives it a premium feel. Now, apart from the body, Huawei did a great job with its version of EMU software over the android. For those coming from an Iphone, you would feel right at home with this device because they have completely removed the android app tray and every app installed shows up like how it would on an IOS. The software is lively, but feels more like IOS than an android. So if you are coming from an iphone, you'll feel right at home. Apart from that, I love the themes that you can use to customize your device. I love the piano theme and if you register to their EMU site, they open up more options. The software is really nice and I love the features provided.Now come the cons. The volume buttons are right next to the power button on the right side and I've had several occasions where, I end up pressing the volume down button during a call or sometimes powering off the phone. I think there are different versions out on amazon, because I only could get 4G on the T-mobile network but no LTE. As far as battery life, for those who like removal batteries would surely be disappointed, and secondly it really doesn't last that long considering it has a huge battery.All in all, it is TRULY a Gorgeous phone that you'd love to show off with your friends. Iphone users would find it similar to IOS and can thus comfortably relate to it. I'll give it to my MOM for her birthday and just wait till they release Huawei ascend mate 8","1","helpful"

It works without any problems.There are some minor things which I have to get used to as I was using a Samsung (SII) before which had some better ergonomic solutions, e.g. a ""real"" push button instead of touch button on the bottom of the screen or on/off button being on the same side of the phone as the volume button. Those are small things but Samsung solutions are better from this point of view. Also it seems that the phone can either have two sim cards or have one sim card and memory card. So if you are using two sim cards you will probably not be able to use memory card but I will figure this out when I will be back home as I am travelling now.

"HUAWEI SnapTo 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android 4.4 Smartphone - White/Black","HUAWEI","104","4","When I first got this phone, I didn't know how to use it but eventually, I got to find out about the features the phone has. One of the features the phone has is that it has a flashlight app which I can use to search for things in darkness, a f.m radio app, and a phone manager app which allows you to scan your phone for any viruses, closes any open apps, etc. Apart from those apps I mentioned earlier, there are other features the phone has as well, but you would have to buy it in order to discover them. The only drawback is that the phone freezes sometimes, but other than that, it is OK for any person to use as long as there is a sim card in the phone which will activate the phone service.","1","helpful"

I'm used to android and microsoft phones seem okay, but the app store has nothing in it. Half of social media platforms are not available for it (tumblr, instagram, snapchat etc). You're forced to use internet explorer and bing, as microsoft products tend to try and do. It's a decent, well priced phone for a replacement while you wait on something better OR if you want something super simple to just make calls and text. Takes okay pictures and has a forward and rear facing camera. Audio quality is just okay. You can hear it mostly clearly, but it makes most audio sound sort of scratchy.

I know everyone says that it doesn't have enough apps but I have all the ones I want other then an app for my bank but I just pull it up on the browser. Has very good battery life and the os works extremely smooth after a week of playing with it. My guess is the phone is trying to figure out my habits. I wish more people and companies would support the windows phone to get more stuff for it, but its their loss on a great phone. The only thing that could make this phone better is if was the 950. I have an iPhone 6 from work and I had the google phone and I prefer this hands down to the others.","1","helpful"

Nothing I don't like about it.Screen: Excellent response and looks great.Battery: I go a full day on a charge. You may not if you're using it for a wifi connection or voice all day. The fact that the battery is so easily replaceable is HUGE for me. I just carry an extra battery in my backpack. When the battery is low I can simply swap it. Best possible option for me. I've never that guy at the airport running around looking for power like iPhone owners.Cover: This is different from any other phone: the case IS the cover. So when you buy a new case you're replacing the entire cover of the phone. So your case doesn't need to fit over the factory case - it replaces it. Very nice design. So many nice cases available for this phone. I have a leather case that gets compliments all the time.OS: I think you either like Windows Phone OS or you don't. Very intuitive to me. Does what I expect it to when I expect it to. I like the tiled navigation page. So easy to rearrange and resize tiles.The only issues I can see with this and other Windows phones is the lack of software support. Waze, for example is fairly crippled on Windows vs. Android. All the other apps I need are there. But clearly far fewer apps than Android and iPhones have. Not an issue for me.","1","helpful"

It has Continuum, which I was able to try out in a Microsoft store. It was great, pretty much a full PC experience with Excel, PowerPoint and the Edge browser open at the same time. If I had a use for it I'd get the dock, but at $90 it's a bit much for an impulse buy. It's pretty fast and fluid as well, and despite all you hear about the app gap I have pretty much everything I need on the phone.When I got it, though, it would kill the battery in half a day and get really hot. It turned out that the SD card that was working fine in my 1520 wasn't good enough for the 950. You need a really fast card. That fixed the heat and battery drain, though it definitely isn't as good on battery as the 1520 was. I also have issues logging into wifi hotspots, where a login page is needed. Sometimes it doesn't come up and I have to reboot the phone. Still working through that.So, while the 1520 was definitely a 5 star device, the 950 is only a 4 star, until those issues get sorted.","1","helpful"

"Nokia X6 Touch Unlocked GSM Phone with 5 MP Camera and 16 GB Memory (White with Yellow Cap)","Nokia","199","4","Hello everyone. First thing I will say is that the phone itself looks great.The Nokia packaging is not that good, but it does its job well and the phone arrived in excelente shape and with all the announced accessories (I actually expected a nicer packaging, but that is just me I guess).I bought this to replace a Samsung Ommia I900, and before that I had the Nokia 5800 and the fist improvement I noticed in the X6, as it has great response, eventhough it takes a bit to get used to since it is capacitive (Mainly you need to use your finger tips, and not a stylus or ""nails""). It is also a lot faster than the 5800, applications load better, keyboards display better (Nicer screen resolution as well I think) and overall it is easier to handle.The music sound is very nice, and it has 16GB of memory. Would have still liked if it had a Micro SD slot, as some other reviewers have said, even though 16GB is preety much space for regular music and photos.The camera is nicer than the one on the 5800, but lacks some of the functions that the Omnia I900 had like face recognition, smile shutter, etc.Overall, I would deffinitely recommend this smartphone on its price range (Around $300 USD now, I bought it for $50 more), great quality (Nokia has never dissapointed in phone quality, or phone call quality), quadband, works with 3G network (At least here in Colombia), GPS (You can also make the GPS work as a standard service withouth data plans, with some programs like Garmin and some small settings), camera, etc.","1","helpful"

"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)","Sony","269.1","3","I am a big Nokia fan and really liked my 5800 and 5530, so I was quite looking forward to playing with the N97. This is a exquisite piece of hardware, the feel of the device is the nicest of any phone I have owned. But the software is really showing its age, even compared to newer, cheaper Nokia phones.Nokia really are asleep at the wheel, the 5530 shows they can do reasonable job of making a touch phone using S60 but they have let their S60 flagship lag far behind other S60 phones that are less than half the price. I gave both the 5800 navigation edition and the 5530 XpressMusic 5 stars based on the great usability and incredible value, but the wonderful N97 hardware is let down by old software.Good:- Wonderful hardware.- Excellent call quality- Very extensive feature set.- Very nice screen in sunlight.- White color looks great.- Nice keyboard (except space bar).- 32GB internal storage.Bad:- Home screen lacks scrolling contacts of 5530.- Inconsistent touch menu (some double, some single tap).- Very small space bar.- Mediocre browser.- Weak FM transmitter (not powerful enough for car use).- Ovi Maps lack search (you need to have google maps installed too).- No in-line spell check.Don't even waste your time comparing this phone to true smartphones like nexusone, droid or iphone 3gs, its just not in that league software wise, only price wise. When you see what google and apple have done so early in the smartphone game, it really is a shame for Nokia. Such great hardware let down by such bad software. And before you say N900, I had one and returned it, maemo shows promise but is far from ready for primetime use and the hardware is a brick.If you have lots of money, already like Nokia S60 phones and have never used an iphone or droid you should love this phone. Everyone else steer clear of it, looks at the 5800 or 5530 if you wanna go Nokia.","1","helpful"
"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)","Sony","269.1","4","Tengo una semana de estar utilizando este tel├⌐fono celular. Es mi primer Nokia y al principio fue un poco frustrante por que no sab├¡a donde buscar las aplicaciones, yo estaba acostumbrado a los celulares Sony Ericksson y me sent├¡a muy c├│modo con ellos pero por las caracter├¡sticas que presentaba el N97 su gran cantidad de memoria ser de tecnolog├¡a 3G, los buenos comentarios que hab├¡a escuchado y por precio decid├¡ comprarlo en lugar de un Sony Ericksson.Como mencion├⌐ al principio me frustr├⌐ pero era mas por desconocimiento que otra cosa por ejemplo le instal├⌐ el navegador Opra mini ya que el navegador que el trae no me gustaba pero cuando me conectaba a Internet lo hac├¡a atravez del navegador predeterminado y yo no sab├¡a que ten├¡a que entrar a aplicaciones y de ah├¡ accesar a Opra. Pero poco a poco fui encontrandole las aplicaciones y debo decir que ahora estoy muy contento.Las cosas buenas de este celular:1) Esteticamente es muy lindo, la resoluci├│n de la pantalla hace que las im├ígenes se vean muy n├¡tidas.2)La c├ímara y el video no tienen nada que envidiarle a un artefacto dedicado es decir a una c├ímara digital o a una videocamara, las fotos son muy bien logradas y el flash realmente funciona en lugares oscuras se pueden apreciar perfectamente los detalles.3) La conexi├│n a Internet es muy buena, gracias al zoom puedes agrandar o disminuir la im├ígenes las cuales se aprecian muy bien, logicamente hay p├íginas que por ser tan grandes no se observaran como en la computadora, pero en realidad la navegaci├│n es placentera siempre y cuando no tengas que estar digitando algo.4) Conectarte a las redes sociales o a tu correo electr├│nico esta a un click de distancia y como dige antes en segundos y puedes leer archivos en formato de word excel o PDF. Es decir si no estas cerca a de una computadora no hay ning├║n problema te sacar├í del apuro, aunque repito la experiencia aun no es como con la computadora pero ese es un problema en todos los tel├⌐fono inteligentes. Yo reviso mis estados de cuenta, puedo hacer una compra en Amazon pagar recibos entrar al banco hacer transacciones, etc, etc.5) El tel├⌐fono es robusto se ve fuerte aunque aun no se ha llevado ning├║n golpe6) Tiene todas las funciones de los tel├⌐fonos convencionales pero a diferencia de otros estas realmente cumplen por ejemplo si tienes una grabadora tu esperas que cuando des click esta realmente grabe y esta lo hace, yo he tenido telefonos que cuando quise usar la grabadora esta simplemente no funcion├│. Puedes vivar con ello pero da c├│lera que una aplicaci├│n no funcione como debiera.Pero bueno no todo es perfecto y lo que no me gust├│ es lo inc├│modo que resulta a veces el teclado qwerty a veces cuando estoy navegando si por alguna raz├│n tengo que digitar algo puedo desplegar texto en pantalla pero en otras ocasiones esta caracter├¡stica no esta disponible y me obliga a usar el teclado y no se si es la falta de costumbre pero soy mucho mas diestro con las teclas de un tel├⌐fono que con este tipo de teclado y me demoro mucho por lo que me resulta engorroso. Pero bueno no se talvez dentro de unos meses ya me halla acostumbrado.Pero por lo dem├ís creo que son mucho mas las satisfacciones imaginense pueden utilizar este tel├⌐fono como un GPS yo en la particular no lo uso por que ya tengo un Garmin que es una belleza y al cual ya estoy super acostumbrado pero bueno esta es una aplicaci├│n que bien vale la pena utilizar si esta disponible. En sintes├¡s le digo comprelo no se va a arrepentir, a y se me olvidaba la pantalla t├íctil funciona a las mil maravillas esta era una de mis principales dudas, pero me di cuenta que si funciona y excelentemente bien, el secreto es calibrarla la pantalla a tu gusto, si gustas de apretar mucho el l├ípiz pues as├¡ la calibras a mi me gustan los trazos suaves y as├¡ la calibr├⌐ y apenas dejo caer el l├ípiz y la funci├│n se aplica. As├¡ es que es una buena inversi├│n la ├║nica raz├│n por la que no le d├¡ cinco estrellas fue por la raz├│n del teclado por lo dem├ís no hay quejas.","1","helpful"
"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)","Sony","269.1","2","This is an expensive phone with three major problems for which I gave it a two-star. First, the reception is much weaker comparing to my old phone (Motorola Ming). Once the reception is lost, it could take a minute or more for you to be able to see some signal bars appeared again. Second, the connection is another issue for this cell phone. It gives a lot of ""connection error"" messages, and I have experienced way more call drops since I changed to this cell phone. Also, the home screen rotates easily from vertical to horizontal, but it doesn't do the same backward. I have to shake the phone with some strength for the home screen rotate back to vertical. Overall, I am very disappointed with Nokia N97, but since I paid a good amount of money for it, I have to stick with it for a while.","1","helpful"

This phone is so easily accessible and everything is where it should be. My only knocks on it is the GPS Signal is not very strong. I will have wide open blue skies and still cant get a GPS signal. Also I wish it was compatible with the Internet Radio that Nokia offers. I am sure it is only a matter of time. Some great things about this phone is the Video Ringtones the OVI Store, OVI Contacts, and I especially like the 32GB Internal Memory. It can be an MP3 Player and with the FM Transmitter good bye to CDs and I dont even use my iPod anymore. I also love the fact that the homescreen apps are up to date. I have Facebook, Weather, and a Video Game App that always let me know whats going on. The camera is amazing and has a great flash. I went to Vegas and took my digital camera and ended up not using it. I just used my N97. The battery life is great too. I had the fm transmitter on all day, along with normal phone calls, browsing the internet and excessive text messaging I still had 4 bars before I went to bed. I would recommend this phone to all. I also bought a phone cover from [...]. It is an extraordinary Industrial Strength full Phone cover and it is guaranteed for life so if it breaks they will replace it for free.","1","helpful"

A lot of bugs - some solving with 2.0 Firmware, some not - like bad first Facebook app (now, better). The problem with landing page (the page of gadgets) continues I think because this stout cellphone needs a Intel processador - may be - like Duo Core for Nokia :). I really believe if this could possible, this Nokia N97 might be better than seems...The camera looks like ok, but always when I take a picture with flash, the weard fog appears in the corner below, left side...Istead of I like the qwerty keyboard it's ok and the apps available could be better in Ovi portal.","1","helpful"

"Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)","Sony","199.99","5","I originally wanted the Sony Xperia Z3, but for less than half the price I finally decided to buy the M4 Aqua GSM/LTE Unlocked. All in all it's a great phone (so far after 1 month). Build quality is good, processor is fast, and the screen is beautiful. Battery lasts for 2-3 days but I'm not a heavy user. Regarding the heating/overheating issues mentioned in other reviews, I only encountered this while I was playing a game - the phone did seem hot but wasn't too bad because I was using a protective case and the phone performance wasn't affected. One other point: I previously used a Sony Xperia S and the camera was terrible - the camera on the M4 Aqua is much better and takes great photos so this is a definite improvement. I'm very pleased with this phone and for the price it's a winner!","1","helpful"
"Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty)","Sony","199.99","3","I picked up this phone when it was a little less in price due to the water proof capabilities. I have always liked the little UI improvements Sony has done to the Android interface. It isn't overdone and bloated like the Samsung's, its way more elegant and simple in my opinion. It's much closer to a ""stock"" android experience. Also the stamina mode is a cool addition, depending on how you use your phone of course.The only thing that is holding this phone back is the bad snapdragon processor(Snapdragon 615) that is in this device. It isn't bad per se, but it over heats so quick it throttles the processor back so it makes the phone feel slower than it should be. This is the same issue that the Snapdragon 810 had. If this phone didn't have this processor it would be so much easier for me to suggest to someone.The phone itself is nice. Its thin, light and fits fairly well in the hand for a 5"" phone. It isn't the narrowest phone out there, like the newer xperia xa, but it isn't horrible. O yeah, its also water and dust proof! I don't do any heavy gaming on my mobile devices so I can't comment on that. The none 3D heavy games functioned fine for me though(it does get hot on the back though).This phone is updated to android 6.0.1 so it's good that sony kept up with that. I'd assume this is going to be the last update it gets.Battery life was good for me. I'll give some info on how I use my phone so you can compare. I use 3 mail aps for email, with one of them being the included gmail app. Facebook, snapchat, some news feed aps, hangouts for sms and another 2 social aps. With using all those a few times over a 10 hour span I was over 60% all of the time. Thats very good for me and comparable to an iphone 6 I also have.Overall I do like the phone, but the snapdragon 615 holds its back from being a truly good phone.","1","helpful"

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","Alcatel","129","5","Absolutely love this device. Once I heard Alcatel was selling a phone with such good specs at such a low price I jumped at the pre-order and I am so glad I did. Although the phone was delivered to my neighbor, and after some worried searching saw it on their porch, I have no problems since my order was upgraded to two day shipping.The device is very light weight and very thin. Its screen is beautiful and very bright. Full, rich color from all viewing angles. The speakers are much better than expected, very loud with solid lows and sharp highs. The headphones provided are of very good quality with phenomenal sound and deep bass. The rear camera is quite good for videos but sub par for stills. The quality in a low light setting is very dull and scratchy. The front camera is a different story. Very rich detail and contrast with a very noticable difference in a low light setting, the pictures are much clearer.The battery is very good. With an average day of usage mostly consisting of YouTube and Facebook I had almost 35% left at the end of the day.The snapdragon processor is a big plus in this device. It is very snappy and holds its own in demanding apps. There is a little lag only when clearing recent apps.The android 5.0 is excellent and very clean on this device.Although the phone is made out of plastic, I must say it has a very durable and quality feel to it. Since the back cannot be removed there is no creaking when force is applied.Overall I must say that this phone is worth every penny and I would highly reccomme d to anybody on a budget.","2","helpful"

It's late Sunday afternoon. Pretty confident I can go without charging again tonight and still have a bit of battery life left at three full days (72 hours) without being pugged in. The battery on the Galaxy S6 was utter garbage and couldn't sit on a table without being touched for 24 hours and not die on me. Really can't tell you how impressed I am with this phone. It performs as well if not better in every way then my S6 with the exception mentioned above in camera quality. In all fairness I've only owned the phone for a week so lets see how it holds up over time.It feels very well built and hopefully it will hold up over time.

"ASUS ZENFONE 6 A601CG 6"" Android 4.3 16GB Dual-SIM Smartphone (Black) - International Version No Warranty","asus","273.78","5","First of all I want to say I have been an Apple user since the iPhone 4s came out. Big Apple fan. Until I decided to switch it up and never sign a 2 year phone service contract again. Looking for a unlocked international phone in case I move out of the country, I found this. At a couple hundred dollars (cheaper than a 16gb Apple 4s) I found this phone to be affordable and impressive for the price on paper. Upon receiving the device and setting it up I was impressed at the quality and sheer screen size of the thing. It has a clear and crisp screen, lots of RAM, great camera, large battery and is very user friendly. This is my personal opinion and I am by no means a phone snob. I previously replaced an iPhone 5 16gb with the zenphone 6 and do not regret it whatsoever except for the fact tthat the iPhone was in no way needing replaced. Now I have this and absolutely love it. It is awesome and I would recommend the phone to family and friends all day.","2","helpful"

"ASUS ZenFone2 Unlocked Smartphone, 16GB, 4GB RAM, Black - ZE551ML (U.S. Warranty)","Asus","168.34","2","After using Amazon for 10+ years, this is the first product experience that has given me the motivation to write a review.I bought this phone to use with Cricket Wireless, and wanted to like it badly. I did, for a relatively short time. It looks amazing, the screen is beautiful, and I even like the Zen UI, which many complain about. The phone was fast, the camera was OK, and the 'official' flip cover and screen were a really cool feature. Many even complain about battery life, but I thought it was fine. It wouldn't last all day if I used it heavily, but on standby or just for talking and text, it would last. And for $6, I purchased the quick charger which would recharge to about 70% in half an hour.After a few months of being in love with this phone, it slowly started to break my heart. I'd have the occasional random restart, but fine, I could live with that. I'd play Pandora at work, and the music would stop playing after a song or two if I closed the cover. That kind of sucked, but I remained in love. Then, 4-5 months into the experience, various apps would randomly 'lock up', or simply not work.Then the day finally came, where I gained the realization that I knew this wasn't going to last. It happened when I needed to make an important phone call. I press the phone app icon, and get a message that 'Phone' cannot be opened. Or something along those lines. I tried the power boost (a task killer), and it still wouldn't work. I'd have to restart in order to use the device as a phone again. This started happening more frequently (not all the time, but enough to be a problem, like 1 - 2 times per week), and started happening to the Messaging app as well, among others.After that, the 'flip cover mode' became an issue. It's a really cool feature if you have the flip cover, which has a large, clear circle on the cover, so when you flip it closed, the screen changes to a circle that fills the window perfectly, showing you the date and time, calendar events, allows you to play music, etc. But, it's supposed to go away and return to a normal user mode when you open the cover. Within months 5-6, it often didn't exit this mode, which means it's just stuck in an useless mode, and all you can do is restart the thing. Blindly. Holding down the power button for random intervals until it eventually shuts itself off.Between the locking flip cover mode and the freezing apps, I had fallen out of love in just under 6 months.Then, it left me for good. One day, it had a hard time turning on. And when it did, it would only enter the flip cover mode, even though I no longer had the flip cover attached. So it was totally useless. In this mode, it would either A) just stay that way, or B) randomly restart itself, reentering the same useless mode. It simply didn't want to interact with me anymore.AND APPARENTLY, NEITHER DOES CUSTOMER SUPPORT AT ASUS! You see, I called them, told them what was up, gave them all the necessary information, and even let them hang up and call me back hours later because their computers were down. I would need to RMA the phone, which means sending it in at my own expense, and hoping they can fix it while I remain without a phone.Fine. I'll cooperate. I want my phone repaired. They said it would take 5-7 days once received. So I went to my house that same day, got out the original packaging, packed it nice and securely, bought a spiffy new box from the post office, and sent it priority mail, the same day.I just checked the RMA status update site, and it says something to the tune of 'Product not received - if you have delivery confirmation that it has been delivered more than 24-48 hours ago, please contact customer service.' Well, I do have delivery confirmation, and it was delivered...10 DAYS AGO. They still haven't updated the status to even RECEIVED yet! I've called, I've had a support guy tell me they have received it but not started working on it, after having it for a week. When I asked why and when the website wasn't updated, the rep just talked in circles. 'It takes 24-48 hours''yeah but it has been a week'silence'when will they update it''it takes 24 to 48 hours, so probably 24 to 48 hours from today'Nope.I've called again today, and get transferred to a dead end line.I'll update my review if this goes anywhere. But as it stands for now, the rumors I've heard are verified to be true. ASUS builds nice looking stuff that is short lived because it is of poor quality, and the customer support is the epitome of unsupportive.UPDATE 1: The product was flagged as received, with no other additional information reported, 10 days after it was received.UPDATE 2: I've called and asked for updates and a new phone. The customer service center, while English speaking, is sort of disconnected from the repair center, so there is a wall between customer service and repair, allowing customer service to acknowledge your concerns, then email the repair center and wait for a response. The customer service rep looked into getting a new phone sent to me, sent an email asking about this, but a reply was never received.UPDATE 3: My phone (from what I can tell, the original, not a replacement, based on serial number in my RMA) was scheduled for return. Due to the delays to date, I've called twice in a week to make sure it is on it's way. I am only told 'it should be on its way soon, but they can't guarantee it.' That is as specific as customer service can be.UPDATE 4: My phone is flagged as shipped. The only info I've been given is that the phone is on it's way - as stated previously, the same phone, judging by serial number - and that it should be received by a date that almost exactly 1 month since ASUS received it when I sent it back. Perhaps the most frustrating part of this update - ASUS used a standard FEDEX shipping method (similar to UPS GROUND) to return the phone, even though they've had it for a month. No concern for my constant calls; I thought the least they would do was sent it at a speed that I sent it to them (I sent 2-day shipping at my expense).","2","helpful"

My main issue is that it doesn't have full compatibility with my local carrier. Now this is NOT AN UNLOCKED PHONE. But I was able to get an unlocke code from eBay for $3. It took three days for them to email the code. This phone uses a sim card and my simple mobile service doesn't support 4g on the specific operating system the phone comes with. Other than that, I'm perfectly happy with the phone. It takes micro SD cards and you should buy a case for it. This phone it's definitely not invincible. The amount of ram is perfect for my needs.

GSM/GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 also work but for 2G only.AT&T 3G network uses 850/1900 so this phone will not work at 3G speed on that either.If you're planning on using the phone in the USA don't buy this version.","2","helpful"
"HTC A510e Unlocked Phone with Android 2.3.3, 5MP Camera, WiFi, GPS and Bluetooth - No Warranty - Black","HTC","119.94","3","I purchased this product and was expecting a fully unlocked handset. Upon arrival to Bangkok for usage, I quickly learned the handset was not data unlocked, and only voice/SMS (SIM) unlocked. I took the handset to MBK mall and some phone ninjas were able to unlock the data piece for THB 700 (about $23USD). Afterwards, the 3G components worked fine on AIS and DTAC SIMs/plans.Not sure if this was a Thai anomaly but be warned the handset I received was not fully unlocked as advertised. Be prepared to have a plan/time/funds in place to fully unlock the handset. Other than this - the phone is Vodaphone with a 220V charger, and I was able to upgrade to Gingerbread 2.3.5 (via WiFi) before the ninjas hax0red it for me. However, I feel this handset is essentially locked in at the current OS level, as the 3G unlock could possibly be removed if I upgrade the OS (unknown, but am not going to risk it at this point...)Phone is small, lightweight, easy to use, and has a good battery life. I recommend it for those who need something when traveling overseas. Just be ready to unlock the data piece if necessary.","2","helpful"

"LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smart Phone, 5.2"" Ice Blue, 32GB Storage, US Warranty","LG Electronics","325","2","I actually like this phone - I would've given the phone an overall 4 star - it's light weight, sturdy and solid in feel. The back texture is smooth but grippy, and doesn't seem prone to the normal oil degradation that occurs with most rubberized paints. The operating system is Android 6, Marshmallow, and really enjoyable to use. The camera is decent, doesn't top my old Nokia Lumia, (single) speaker is extremely loud and clear. The phone does get hot when in charge and watching videos. The battery life is medium, I could expect about 2-3 days of standby in a good coverage/wifi area - any other time i can drop to less than 3/4 of a day.Now, the reason for the 2 stars - having owned this phone for less than a month, the phone decides to crap out. Touch screen doesn't work in certain areas, left side/all of the screen is distorted with bars. I included a picture - that's not from the camera folks, that's probably from some blow capacitor in the device. I was hoping i'd have a trouble free experience, maybe for at least 90 days. This is only my second LG electronic item I purchased, the first one being a monitor and great, sold off and don't know the current condition, but I was not surprised this happened, given the low price of the phone and the reputation of the Goldstar company. Hopefully the replacement will last much longer, but I pray the warranty will cover me beyond a year as I don't plan to upgrade before then.","2","helpful"

Never used a google phone before this one.Pros:- suitably fast- fingerprint scanner- light- screen is nice- camera is decent and the default phone app is sufficient- matte backing is nice, but easily gets smudgy- build doesn't feel cheapCons:- 2GB is not enough ram. I'm feeling like I should have gone with the 6P instead because of this, but I didn't want that large of a screen anymore...- constantly unlocking my screen because of the thumbprint scanner when grabbing for it in my pocket...which might also be a positive- the USB-C format is highly annoying, but mostly because most chargers you buy are garbage and not regulated properly, and the charging cables aren't really used except for this device right now. This means you have to buy MORE cables (and I'm sure you have 100 USB-A MicroUSB cables now) or buy an adapter, and google doesn't really provide them properly. Also, no first party car chargers that I could find that also charge another device. There are some on amazon, however.- the phone gets really hot with some apps, to the point of rebooting on long playtimes. It gets hot in general.- doesn't say Nexus 5X on the back.- CPU could be a bit more powerfulOverall, I'm satisfied for what's clearly a slight downgrade from the Note 3, but for the price, it's worth it if you're in the market for a cheap phone that isn't a ""phablet"".","2","helpful"

It does have the LED notification to let you know if you have a message (it will notify you at the time it comes in, but if you aren't there you won't know unless you actually look at your phone). Not the biggest deal in the world, but for some people that might be annoying. Also it does have the ability to do Android Pay, so if that is something that you want then you will need to look elsewhere.But honestly I think this is a really great phone. I am a Verizon customer and I wanted an unlocked phone that I could take to any network if I wanted to and you can with this. Highly recommend.","2","helpful"

"Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads","Motorola","149.99","5","Was n market for replacement for my HTC ONE M 8 which needs new battery and charging port after 2 years of service. First off very seldom use yhe camera on any phone ever. Maybe just me but if I want a picture I'll bring my Nikon not any phone period can take a picture that I want to save and enlarge . That said I already like this phone for ease of use and fast access. Comes with minimal apps. And charge lasts forever I mean using auto display and if you set it to not search for wi fi may battery is lasting over 36 hours . Now that's not using it much for www and I plug it into usb port on car stereo instead of Bluetooth but do that with all my phones. That's why I bought this phone I bought Moto X for wife and shes had it 2 years and still holds charge great and never a hiccup.Geez peeps read the ad it clearly defined that it has ads. And really that's a prob, you most likely found this phone from a Prime redirect anyway. Quit bitchin and complaining and go buy iPhone for 5 or 6 X's as much. Disable apps you don't need and it works as good as anything else","2","helpful"

The OS is really nice, at least a step up from me as a previous iPhone user. Back when I got it, the apps were pretty limited. Now that has been taken care of for most apps.","2","helpful"

"Nokia Lumia 1020 RM-877 32GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 41MP Camera - White (International Version)","Nokia","199.99","1","This review is for this specific listing of the Lumia 1020. I purchased this phone a few months, intending to use it when I went abroad in September. I recently decided to verify that it was in fact unlocked.It's not.The phone did not come unlocked, and no unlock code was included with the original shipment. This listing's title needs to be updated, or the seller, Joycell, needs to accurately post their wares. I specifically purchased using this listing because it was unlocked, and the price seemed reasonable. Had I know it wasn't unlocked, I wouldn't have purchased it.Fortunately, I put in an unlock request with AT&T, and they granted it. However, I've had those turned down before for other phones, and I would have been in a bad situation if they had chose not to allow it.The phone itself is great, and once again, the 1-star rating is for this specific listing. I purchased the phone from Joycell.","2","helpful"
"Nokia Lumia 1020 RM-877 32GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 41MP Camera - White (International Version)","Nokia","199.99","5","Two years ago I bought my first smartphone, a Lumia 820. I found that I was using the 8MP camera more than my Cannon 14MP point and shoot. The pictures from the 820 were mostly better than my 5 year old camera. When I saw I could buy the 1020 for $315 I ordered the 1020, yellow because I like the visibility.My new Lumia 1020 showed up on time, new in a sealed box. This phone comes with a dead battery, so don't be alarmed when it takes a few minutes to start up. Just plug it in and wait. Before I pulled the sim card from my old phone I set up my wifi with my new phone and started the updates, there are three to get your phone up to Windows Phone 8.1. It takes a while to get the ""gears spinning"", be patient.Windows Phone 8.1 has the Cortana assistant, the superburb Here Mapping and Drive software, and the live tiles makes for a pleasant experience. The lack of apps is an overblown statement. There are plenty of apps.After the updates I installed the sim and started installing my apps, a process that took till late evening. As I have an AT&T account the swap over was painless and simple.This phone is only slightly larger than my Lumia 820 with the new case I bought, right off I noticed that the 1020 didn't slip into my back pocket as easily, it is ""fatter"" with the protruding lens, but that's ok.The camera is great, lots of settings and features. It is the main reason I bought this, I wanted to step up a bit but not be tethered to a camera when my phone is always with me. I like the 41MP camera for zooming in without loss of detail.One detail that has improved much is the ""sync"" app for music and photos. I was pleasantly surprised how fast my music uploaded from my computer to the 1020, 7.3 GBytes worth. Two years ago this app was very slow and I ended up transferring my music manually. Today's sync app works very well!In all everything works as well as my older Lumia did.Make sure to buy a protective case. I bought the Specks Products Candy Shell Grip case, in yellow, for my 1020, I like it's raised lip on both sides and easy to hold onto style.","2","helpful"

Smooth, Shiny and thinner than I expected. The build quality and materials are excellent, real metal and glass, no more plastic. I am upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active as my personal phone. The S6 Edge is sleek by comparison. I also have a Note 4 Edge from work and love the wrap around screen. The S6 fits my hand much easier than the Note 4, but either is great. I went with the unlocked phone primarily because I am tired of the constant contract renewals and pressure to ""rent"" their phone. Their sales pitch is all about low monthly payments. However they fail to point out that those payments go on seemingly forever and you don't really own the phone until you pay more than current retail value over the next 24-36 months. Second reason is the color - I know that's a bit shallow, but I want it to stand out from the rest of the phones out there. Last reason is occasionally I travel abroad for work. Finally nice to be able to use my own phone and not a throwaway.The only surprise was that the S6 Edge uses the NANO SIM size where my S4 was bigger. Couple of options to remedy this - Get an eXacto knife and cut it down freehand, Take it to your carrier and have them swap it out for a smaller size, or order a cutter on Amazon for under $10. I took option 3, knowing that if I broke it, I can always go to my carrier and get another SIM.","2","helpful"

"Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black)","Sony","129.99","4","I got this for ~$250 new. I have to say, it is an excellent mid-ranger even though the phone is already a year old from launch. I don't know why this phone isn't more popular. It has specs comparable to the Moto X, but is cheaper and with more hardware features such as a micro-sd slot, removable battery, and has certified water-resistance. It even has a dedicated camera shutter button!Sure there are some that will receive a phone hardware defects, but those are usually made rather obvious within the seller's return period, and while some people have battery draining problems with 4.4.2 KitKat, it could be circumvented after looking in the xda forums.Now, there is something that I don't like. The flap on the headphones. They should have nano-coated jack since it is a hassle to open.Now, for some tips, you should definitely get a screen protector as soon as you receive it. The Anti-shatter film is easily scratched. Luckily, it does come with a matte screen protector aside from the anti-shatter film, but it is easily taken off.Getting a dock is also recommended since it would prevent the loosening of the flap on the micro-usb port.","2","helpful"

"VIVO IV Full HD Super Amoled,13MP,(16GB+2GBRAM)-Factory Unlocked (White Silver)","BLU","209.99","4","My review, as of 2 days with the product, will be extensive; only because I believe this phone deserves it.I was very hesitant when considering a Blu phone. Never owned one before neither have seen someone with it. The Vivo Air and Vivo IV both caught my attending because of how beautiful and sleek they look. I didn't go with the Air because of its low ram and camera. So I decided on the Vivo IV and boy...it delivers.Pros:The phone arrived in a white and gold box. Inside, along with the phone, came a clear case and a spare screen protector (the phone had one on it already). It's honestly one of the best looking phones out in the market today...hands down. There was 4+ guess at the house and we all surrounded the phone just amazed by its design.The slimness of the phone isn't a turn off. Yes it's very thin but sturdy. It doesn't have a plastic cheap feel most budget phone bring. Instead there's a $600+ feel to it.Under the hood there's 2gb of RAM which works good with multi tasking your apps. The Super Amoled screen presents colors really good, blacks are really dark and light colors are eye popping.The most controversial part of this phone is its battery. I'm here to say the battery isn't as bad as other reviews say. It has died in four hours. The battery instead holds its ground and will last you a day with usage.Cons:The size. It might be a little to big for a women. My mom seems to be doing okay and she has average size hands.That's really my only complain so far (2 days of use).I will update this review as we get to know the ins and outs of the phone. Overall it's very much a good buy. You definitely get a bang for you buck. This phone is well worth more than it's worth. And that's coming from a loyal BlackBerry 10 user!Approval Stamp!","2","helpful"

GPS has also been pretty bad for me to. As for the case that came with the phone I like it but I also don't like it. I like it because people can still see how beautiful the phone is when the case is on. But I dislike it because this case will not protect you phone from any drops.As far as for the octacore processor I do see lag here and there but nothing to bad.

"VIVO IV Full HD Super Amoled,13MP,(16GB+2GBRAM)-Factory Unlocked (White Silver)","BLU","209.99","5","This phone is the thinnest smartphone on the market right now (only 5.5 mm thick). I've had it for about a month now and it has been great. The octacore processor is super fast and both front and rear cameras are of great quality. The screen is crystal clear and has a 441 ppi density which is higher than the iphone 6 and iphone 6+. The screen is super vivid. I've used a countless number of phones including the HTC One m7, m8, iphone 5s, iphone 6, BLU Studio 5.5s, and almost all the Samsung Galaxy phones and in my opinion, the BLU Vivo IV is the best. When you get this phone, it will have one sticker on the back and one sticker on the front. After removing both stickers, there will be another clear plastic sheet on the front. Make sure you take off that plastic sheet as it is not a screen protector and will not let you see the true greatness of the screen. The phone comes with a separate screen protector, earbuds, charging cable, wall adapter, and a plastic case. This phone has BLU's custom skin on it when you get it. If you don't like it you can simply just download a custom launcher like Nova Launcher from the Google Play Store for free. I would recommend this phone to anyone! If you are unsure in buying this phone, I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.","2","helpful"

The phone screen stays on if someone calls you while currently on the phone speakingΓÇª moving it from face and back again did not seem to helpΓÇª screen staying on makes the phone very hot, which will result in a shorter life span of the phone.

Etc. The sony lens and the snapdragon chips make you think the phone is a bargain. The reality is so far from the theory. Poor camera and when i say poor i mean it. A Samsung galaxy prime, chip phone from cricket performance 10 times better for a fraction of the cost. The ""incredible sound"" is a joke. My previous phone the moto pure edition, that's a great sound stuff! This kind of phone can compete with any med level phone like Huawei p8 lite, the only difference is the 150 dlls between both. As soon as i installed the chip i knew was a big mistake got it. Tried to return it but Amazon make me wait like a month to start the refund procedure. My advice don't even read the specs, get a 200 dlls cellphone for the same performance or get a flag ship (a real one) if u can afford it.","2","helpful"

BIG NEGATIVE for me.Speakers: There are two front-facing speaker grills but only one works for playing music or handsfree talking. WTH?Smooth Design but; Also very slippery with dry hands, and since I don't use lotion this is a problem.Weight: The phone is too heavy, especially since the battery life sucks.So if you can live with the above issues, by all means, go ahead and get it, the price is cheap.","2","helpful"

Amazon can be a tad bit of a scary place to buy an unlocked phone. Many don't come with a warranty, are asian versions or are just plain scams as can be seen from the reviews of Galaxy 6s and Notes and other top brands. Not this phone, it is the real deal. I have purchased 3 unlocked phones on Amazon over the last few years since we lived overseas and wanted phones to use internationally with SIMs from different countries. Two of the 3 were problematic and likely clones with major functional flaws. Since this is supplied by Amazon there is the assurance it is an original piece of equipment or easily returnable if not.You get what you pay for and a ton more like the best camera available on a phone and the best sound quality both with and without head phones. The volume and sound on this phone is amazing and by far the loudest and best I have experienced on such a small device.Another bonus is the setup....I was expecting it to take the better part of a day to get contacts and apps installed but with Google backup and NFC it was done in a snap.If there is one drawback it would be that the storage is not expandable with external cards. Also the non replaceable battery is disliked by many but not an issue to me yet since this phone has great battery life. One interesting note is the blue phone is actually black...I thought I got sent the wrong phone but black is not even an option. So don't expect a pretty blue phone, it is more of a matte black.So, go ahead and save yourself a heap of money and get yourself this phone which comes in two days, is returnable, warrantied and one of the best phones of 2015.

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","Alcatel","129","5","A very solid phone for the asking price.I was able to purchase this device during promotion for 199 dollar, but in this review i will compare to the Mate 2, Note 4 and Nexus 4, iphone5, which at the time of my purchase was 300 dollar, 750 dollar, 360 dollar and 600 dollar. I'd like to mention that the asus zenfone 2 is a very capable phone and priced at 199/299, but i do not have a unit to compare with.pro1. build quality is superb. the phone is assembled with high precision, the unit is very thin and very solid. the entire phone has no creaking when pressed and each button has very nice tactile feel. it is very similar to the feeling of Nexus 4, which was also superb in term of build quality and overall finishing.2. the speaker is superb. it is up there with HTC boomsound and i think it might actually better at bass (HTC may be better at treble). at any rate. the speaker is miles apart from anything else and even better than most tables (that includes ipad). the true stereo speaker and high definition sound (for a phone) really helps when you watch video or play game without headphones or boombox. and most importantly, this phone's speaker are very well placed and it hides within the frames. so all the glory without HTC's huge ugly speaker grills.3. screen is awesome. it has one of the brightest screen on a phone. no issue to use in the day light and it is capable of display vivid images at a extreme wide angle. it easily rivals the screen found on iphone 5. in the realm of IPS, this screen is as good as it goes. (but i still prefer the ALMOED on Note 4 better for its deep contrast).4. stock andriod. pretty much the vanilla andriod with very little touch to add alcatel's reversible screen. which means very little overhead and smooth operation.5. support SD card. while most say SD card is useless, i would not purchase a device without capability of expanding storage. i often travel for business and leisure. and many place i go does not have cellphone reception or in an country that cell data is very slow. I always keep the Here map and its offline data in my phone in case i need direction, and that's a good 15 to 20G of data all by itself. and if one uses the phone to take photo or video, he/she will use few gig of storage in a week or two. bottom line, after 9 month of using Note 4, i have already exhausted the 64G SD card and just moved to 200G SD card. and having SD card on a phone, even if you don't think you need it, is a big plus to me.average1. camera is very average for 2015 flagship phone (but very good for 2013 standard). the only other phone i have at the time of the photo comparison is Note 4, which was released in 2014 but has one of the very best camera in smart phone at the time of this review. compared with Note 4, the onetouch idol lacks resolution, white balancing and image sharpness in pretty much any lighting condition. However, i would say that Idol3 does perform very well compared to the flagship phone from two generations ago (e.g. iphone5, Galaxy S4). do bear in mind that this phone does not have a sticking out camera housing like the latest smart phones, and this phone is VERY thin (7.4 mm compared with iphone 5's 7.6 mm). it's optics will suffer even with a capable CMOS sensor.2. performance. again, this phone would have no problem when compared with flagship phones from two generations ago (like HTC M7, S4 or iPhone 5) and might even be slightly faster. which is to say that phone is perfectly capable for daily tasks such as reading email, browsing web or play games (even the very intensive games like implosion). you would probably see occasion lag when scrolling through a huge PDF file or some complicated websites, or a longer loading time for games, but not a deal breaker in my mind. it is not until you doing transcoding or running benchmarks will you see the huge difference between current gen flagship and this phone, but who dose transcoding in the phone anyways?3. reception. in the same location, this phone's reported reception is always about 11 to 15 dbm lower than the Note 4. which would technically translate to 20% of signal strength (since the highest is probably -60 dbm if you standing right next to the tower and lowest usable cell phone strength is around -125).4. compromises: with such wonderful design and display, there are sacrifices has to be made for this release price. for one thing: you don't have 802.11 ac, you don't have Magnetometer or a Gyroscope, all of which zenfone 2 has for similar and cheaper MSRP (199). while i do miss the magnetometer and gyroscope for fast location and direction. i do not miss the 802.11 ac feature. the ac allows you to transfer files at a much greater speed (about twice as fast compared to n in my test with computers), but this is completely useless because the phone's internal storage is so slow that it doesn't matter how fast you can pull down the data. at least on my Note 4, the transfer rate doesn't seem to have any difference when running ac or n.4. processor: i am not against weak processors and i have said this processor does do it job. BUT the 615 is just gimmicky. technically with its octa core, it should be little-big design that you have two cluster of computing units, one is fast but power hungry (A57/A15) while another (A53/A7) is slow but power efficient. but in this device, you have 8 A53 core, just one cluster is clocked faster. REALLY??? qualcomm has no reason to not just release it with standard 4core A53s and add a speed governor to achieve the same effect. in fact, qualcomm said themselves that 615 was released due to market demand for more cores not due to power efficiency or performance. i'd much rather see a 801 or intel's core in this phone than 615 for the similar price.overall, a very solid phone that actually have a good design. it is one of those product that doesn't do all the justice just by reading the spec sheet. you have to see it in person and feel it in hand to appreciate its craftsmanship and balanced performance. while not perfect, it does have a lot of merit for its price tag even at 250 USD.

Yet, this is a $600 smartphone.My wife & I live off our Kindles, so this phone works out of the same Amazon account & Cloud as our Kindles. My wife is having a good time figuring this new toy out (yes, the occasional woman can suffer from ""Men & Their Toys Syndrome""), and is especially pleased that it is replacing a DumbPhone (Patent Pending).She likes the 3-D, the daily picture wallpaper, the audiobooks, and the speed at which she can view & dispose of emails. Her texting has sped up thanks to the feature that gives you 5 or 6 choices of what the next word could be (as opposed to my old rotten Apple that picks what it assumes is the 1 most likely word & sometimes auto-corrects your correct word).On the one we got, hearing through the earpiece isn't great, while hearing through the speakers - e.g., music or audiobooks - IS great. The one we got also looks brand-new, so it couldn't have been used too much.The screen is a bit hypersensitive, so we're trying a protective film next to see if that helps.Despite reading here that some apps are not being properly updated by Amazon, we haven't experienced that personally.Amazing value as a phone, as a toy, as a utilitarian communication device, and as an Amazon shopping portal.

"Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads","Motorola","149.99","5","Tons of reviews on this so I'll just add the most impressive aspects of this amazing phone. Yes, it's just $99 so I didn't expect it to do all the things my Note 3 did. But I also didn't expect it to outperform the Note 3 in all the ways that matter..First, battery life is just ridiculous. With the Note, I was lucky to get through a full day without topping up, and if I forgot to charge overnight I was in trouble the next day. Using the G Play the same way in the same places, I easily get 2 full days. And even though it doesn't claim rapid charging capability, put it on a 2.4A charger and it charges fast!Second, having a very lightly skinned version of Android makes a huge difference. I read all the complaints about Samsung and LG 'bloat' and thought it was a bunch of techy whiners who didn't appreciate the benefits of the manufacturer's skins. Boy was I wrong. The G Play does everything the Note 3 did much more efficiently, and I am able to use over 10 GB of the 12 GB RAM.Third, the Amazon ads that allow the $50 discount on the phone are a non-issue. The are small, easily dismissed from the notifications screen, and if you shop at Amazon, are often even appropriately targeted. The Amazon apps that are preinstalled are not removable, but take up very little RAM.Fourth, the RF performance beats the Note by a mile- LTE, wifi and Bluetooth. Better signal in more places and I live in a very spotty coverage area.Finally, the G Play display is just fine. I don't miss the AMOLED display on the Note- I now realize it was pretty, but not remotely accurate and actually made reading on webpages more fatiguing.Obviously it would be nice to have a magnetometer, barometer, optical image stabilization etc. that the Note 3 had. But it was not worth the tradeoff of having a huge, heavy phone that needed to be fed electrons constantly. And the best part about the Play is if I drop it in a lake, it's no big deal. By backing up my data on google and my apps and settings on Motorola, I just buy a replacement for $99 and I'm back in business in minutes.","3","helpful"

"Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty","Motorola","249","1","Compatibility with Sprint is in Question---First off, to get a SIM for the Sprint network, you have to call customer support and spend upwards of an hour while they figure out which SIM to send you. They'll also want to charge you for it, and charge you for shipping. Since I was on hold for ~45 minutes, I got them to waive both charges.Next, the phone works 80% OK on the Sprint network. However, I had a strange issue where I could not receive text messages (SMS) while on LTE. I would either have to place a call (drops to 3G), send a text (drops to 3G), or force the phone to 3G mode to receive text message in a timely manner, otherwise they might be delayed 8-12 hours!Update: It turns out this was probably a quality control/hardware problem. I also had intermittent LTE coverage with this phone.Sprint blames Bring-your-own-device (BYOD); Motorola blames Sprint. A factory reset may have resolved my issue, but why should a phone used for 3 days require a factory reset?! It might be the firmware update that broke it, but there are compatibility issues that still need to resolve.Similarly, (10/2016) Sprint doesn't provide their ""Sprint Zone"" or voicemail apps in the play store, so it's not 100% compatible from that respect, though alternatives (Google Voice) are an option for some.To use Wifi tethering on this device requires a user to unlock the bootloader (voiding the warranty) and change the tethering flag in the settings, which is a shame, because my 4yr old Galaxy S3 could do this just fine.I ordered replacement phone from Amazon. I received one that had the dreaded ""Ghost Touch when Charging"" hardware issue, rendering the phone mostly useless when plugged in, but SMS worked now.A second replacement (within 2 weeks time) also had the Ghost Touch issue..Similarly, (10/2016) Sprint doesn't provide their ""Sprint Zone"" or voicemail apps in the play store, so it's not 100% compatible from that respect, though alternatives (Google Voice) are an option for some.To use Wifi tethering on this device requires a user to unlock the bootloader (voiding the warranty) and change the tethering flag in the settings, which is a shame, because my 4yr old Galaxy S3 could do this just fine.TL;DR: This Motorola model is a LemonPhone 1: Wouldn't SMS on Sprint LTE (out of the box)Phone 2: Dreaded Ghost Touch issue (out of the box)Phone 3: Dreaded Ghost Touch issue (2 days after opening)Tons of information in the Motorola and Sprint community forums","3","helpful"

I just did a ""forced upgrade"" from my previous phone, Sony Xperia Z1s to this, Sony Xperia Z5 Premium.

Anyway I been having this phone on my radar since it was released, so I bought it. Seller shipped it quick, and it arrived ahead of time! :D The phone itself is awesome and the 4K is beautiful! The PS4 Remote Play feature is a HUGE PLUS! Works great, a little laggy at times but playable. The Chrome background is nice and camera is flawless. Phone is FAST! I received a Chinese Version of this phone, and I am using T-Mobile USA. The 4G LTE works but does not display, but with a Internet Speed Test you will see it is there.

I've been babying it and taking care of the phone as much as possible, and in that time I've fallen in love. My personal experience is the UI is nice and clean, similar to stock Android with a few added extras, and it's very responsive. I know it's not 4K all the time, and until the Marshmallow update releases, there won't be much support as of yet, however the up scaling of videos in the YouTube app still look simply amazing. The camera isn't really want most hyped it up to be, but I find that it works well and edges out my Note 4 and my father's iPhone 6S Plus, which is perfect enough for me.From the general feel of the build quality, I'd have to mark Sony down as the ""Apple"" of Androids, since I haven't personally felt that the other Android devices did it for me. I tried the Note 5, S6 Edge Plus, iPhone 6S Plus, Nexus 6P, and multiple others, but the Xperia takes the cake in feeling the most premium to me. Calls sound crystal clear, and the front facing speakers, while not as powerful as some HTC or Motorola phones, still sound much better than my previous iPhone.All in all, love the device, hope Sony continues to push out updates for it in the future, and I may stick with them should they continue producing this type of quality into their devices.","3","helpful"

It made a great first impression when it showed up. I could not use it as a phone for a short time, because I did not have a micro sim for it. I ordered a micro sim cutter and cut my old Straight Talk At&t sim card. It fit perfectly and I got immediate results. The cool thing about this is that Straight Talk has no idea I am using this instead of my old phone. One issue I have had so far was I couldnt figure out how to get the data to work. It ended up being an easy fix though, cause all I had to do was modify the APN settings. There are a lot of haters out there saying the battery life sucks, but so far it has been better than I expected. The phone offers all kinds of options to save on battery power. With limited use I could make a full charge last 2-3 days. It showed up already set up with Android Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) which is also great. I read and watched a lot of reviews on this phone and everyone was saying its a great ""middle of the road"" smartphone, but I say its right up there with at least an Iphone 4S. The camera is exactly what I wanted, and the dual processor is really quick and smooth. If you are looking to save money by using a no contract GSM carrier, this is a great way to go.","3","helpful"

It will work in the US, but only with at&t networks if you want decent data speeds. I didn't realize that the sp comes in three different models that differ only in network compatibility. This phone is perfect if you are traveling abroad, but do your research before you buy it. One of the other 2 would be better for using strictly stateside. This phone does not accommodate the 1900 or 1700 spectrum for either 3g or 4g.

"Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty)","Sony","499.99","5","I recently purchased the White US version of the X Compact for $350 after a great two years with this phoneΓÇÖs grandfather the Z3C. After debating whether to purchase the X Compact, Galaxy S7, Google Pixel and Honor 8, IΓÇÖm quite happy with my decision. There have been some extremely critical reviews of the device - discrediting it as no longer being the compact flagship, but for the niche market that enjoys small-form factor android phones, the device is top of class. This review will highlight some of the unique features that IΓÇÖve encountered as well as addressing some of the harsh criticisms IΓÇÖve seen in other reviews.Design:IΓÇÖve always been a fan of SonyΓÇÖs clean and minimalist design language for its Xperia line and this phone is no exception. In a market where every phone seems to have a utilitarian brushed metal or flashy, shiny design, the white model of this phone is a refreshing change. The looped edges (which are very akin to the Lumia Windows Phones) and small size of the device offer the perfect dimensions for one handed operation without performing a balancing act with your fingers. The 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly loops into to back of the unit which offers a unique feeling IΓÇÖve never experienced. The phone also does a great job of catching the light in interesting ways and it's been the first phone IΓÇÖve used that has literally turned heads when walking down the street.Build:Many people have been really harsh on this phone for having a plastic rear. While it is true that it can be easily scratched, I think Sony has gracefully addressed one of the biggest complaints of their previous lines while keeping true to their design aesthetic. Let me explain: the two predecessors to this phone, the Z3C and Z5C both had glass panels on the rear of the phone. While elegant and more scratch resistant than plastic, the phones were prone to spontaneous cracking, even while in a case. Sony could have gone the route of using a metal back, but at the cost of poor reception or having a plastic chin (like the Xperia XZ), but it would go against their clean slab design language theyΓÇÖve retained for the previous lines. As someone who has always used his phone with a case or a skin, having the plastic back is not a problem for me.Another pain-point with this phone has been the lack of waterproofing that the Xperia line has become iconic for. After seeing videos online of people verifying the waterproofing and testing for myself, I can confirm that this phone is in fact waterproof. I canΓÇÖt make any claims for the actual ingress rating, but IΓÇÖve been able to use my phone in the shower everyday since purchasing the phone without problems. My theory is the Sony omitted waterproofing as a an on-paper feature for this phone because it new that labor costs of repairing warranty claims for the device would not be cost effective for the volume sold to the US and UK markets, where larger devices reign supreme. If that isnΓÇÖt evidence enough, the X Compact in Asian markets have the waterproof rating where smaller phones are more popular and where Sony has more resources to make warranty claims.The final pain-point IΓÇÖve seen with this phone is the fact that the US version does not have a fingerprint scanner. It does indeed have a fingerprint scanner, but because of a patent conflict with Hewlett-Packard, Sony had to disable it for the US markets. If youΓÇÖre willing to get your hands dirty with android development, you can actually download and install the signed, UK firmware of the phone to enable the fingerprint scanner. As a plus, since the firmware is official and signed by Sony, you will not lose your warranty if you conduct the procedure. And what a fingerprint scanner it is. The scanner is extremely accurate, placed in the perfect position and unlocks my phone before I even I can even pull it out of my pocket.As for the rest of the phone, the device has the signature dual front facing speakers that are a huge improvement from the Z3C speakers. They wonΓÇÖt wow anyone with their loudness, but theyΓÇÖre perfect having crisp clean audio for sharing media with friends. The camera button is always welcomed and has a tactile dual click to allow focus lock before capture when taking pictures. The volume controls, on the other hand are in an awkward place. Sony has a tendency to place the volume buttons close to the camera shutter for use as a zoom keys, but IΓÇÖve noticed that I more often than not pinch the screen to zoom in so I would love to see those keys moved to the upper-left side of the device.Display:This is hands down one of the most gorgeous displays I have ever used. IΓÇÖve held this phone up to a Google Pixel (which has an AMOLED screen) and this device can go toe-to-toe with the PixelΓÇÖs Brightness and Saturation despite having a LCD panel screen. It's absolutely incredible how beautiful the display is. The colors are juicy and watching movies on the device is. That being said,unfortunately because it is an LCD panel it cannot achieve the absolute blackness that an AMOLED screen can. For me, itΓÇÖs not noticeable enough to bother me but I can see how that could be an issue for people coming from AMOLED devices.Many people have been hyper-critical of the fact that this phone uses a 720p display in 2016. A 720p display is perfect for a display this size. iPhones have had similar resolutions for years without any complaint. Here is a comparison with the current gen iPhone handsets:iPhone SE: 4.0inch Screen at 1136 x 640 (320 pixels per inch)X Compact: 4.6inch Screen at 1280 x 720 (319 pixels per inch)iPhone 7: 4.7inch Screen at 1334 x 750 (326 pixels per inch)Yes, you can get Android phones with 400+ pixels per inch, but why have a screen that is more demanding on performance and battery life if you canΓÇÖt even discern the individuals with the naked eye? Sony has realized this and chose the optimum screen for the form factor.Performance:Many people have criticized the fact that this device uses a Snapdragon 650 Processor instead of an 820 like its big brother. I think Sony chose this processor for a couple reasons. The smaller resolution of the X Compact means that similar rendering performance can be achieved with a scaled back processor. The 650 is also more power efficient than its big brother, which allows it to achieve the ludicrous battery life that the Compact line is known for. Yes this phone might not have the same raw performance numbers as some of the other top of the line phones on the market, but I have yet to experience any hiccups in any applications IΓÇÖve tried. And at the end of the day, isnΓÇÖt that what really matters?Photo-Quality:This is still one of the primary reasons why I buy Sony phones. Sony devices have one of the most powerful imaging devices for android - if you know how to dial in the settings. The 23 MP Camera allows for fidelity IΓÇÖve never been able to achieve in any phone IΓÇÖve tried. The camera app has all of the controls youΓÇÖd expect from a DSLR, but in a compact size. One of the biggest improvements from the previous camera app is the ability to control shutter speed now. Also, compared to the Z3C, the automatic mode is much better at finding the right settings for the current scene. Handheld and low-light pictures are also much clearer thanks to the new laser auto-focus and improved capture speed. I can speak for the camera all day long, but IΓÇÖll just attach some pictures so you can see for yourself.Battery Life:This is the most battery efficient smart phone IΓÇÖve ever used. My usage habits typically involve using GPS and streaming music on my way to work, checking social media, news and dating apps throughout the day, photo taking in the afternoon and casting media in the evening. I would consider myself someone with heavy use with the exception of playing 3D games. IΓÇÖve been able to go from 8am to 10pm with over 40% battery left without any active battery saving features.IΓÇÖve always been a huge fan of SonyΓÇÖs built in battery saving features. IΓÇÖve tested the device with Stamina Enabled for the full duration of the battery and a more normal usage pattern, and it is a breeze to get up to 3 full days of use. If you want to stretch it even further, you can turn on Ultra Stamina Mode which turns off all your apps sans the basic. With that mode enabled, my phone has predicted that it can go up to 2 weeks.Software:SonyΓÇÖs build of android is almost entirely stock save a couple of power saving features and some bloatware. SonyΓÇÖs own included apps have varying degrees of use. Sony makes one of the best Album apps IΓÇÖve used but things like LifeLog, Xperia Lounge and WhatΓÇÖs New I could do without. As for the third party software, Sony actually includes some useful ones including Amazon Shopping and Swiftkey. Luckily if there is anything you donΓÇÖt like, you can easily disable any apps you donΓÇÖt like.Accessories:One of the biggest downfalls for the device is the accessory support. Two things I usually buy when I get a new phone are a tempered glass screen protector and a Ringke Fusion Case. Because of the negative reception to the phone and low volume, many of the common accessory manufacturers have elected to pass up this device in their production line up. In my attempts to find a screen protector, IΓÇÖve been unable to find any that have a complete adhesive hold to the entire screen; the screen protectors either omit the curved edges or screen protectors that only attach from adhesive on the edges, leaving a noticeable air gap between the screen and protector. Thus, IΓÇÖve had to resort to using SkinomiΓÇÖs screen protector in the interim. Unfortunately Ringke does not have any plans to make their Fusion case for this device, but I was able to find the MicroP TPU case which achieves some similar design aesthetics as the Ringke cases.TLDR:Pros:- Beautiful design- Small form factor phone- Beautiful display- Fast fingerprint sensor- Unofficial but present waterproofing- Insane battery life- Great cameraCons:- Very little accessory support (Cases / screen protectors)- Activating fingerprint sensor requires some tinkering- Volume buttons in an awkward location for use with volumeVerdict:The Xperia X Compact is one of the best options if youΓÇÖre looking for a small form factor phone with an excellent camera and battery life. This phone does have its fair share of nuances that make it less approachable than offerings by Samsung, Xiaomi and Google, but with a little work you can turn the device into an absolute pleasure to use.","3","helpful"

There have been some extremely critical reviews of the device - discrediting it as no longer being the compact flagship, but for the niche market that enjoys small-form factor android phones, the device is top of class. This review will highlight some of the unique features that IΓÇÖve encountered as well as addressing some of the harsh criticisms IΓÇÖve seen in other reviews.Design:IΓÇÖve always been a fan of SonyΓÇÖs clean and minimalist design language for its Xperia line and this phone is no exception. In a market where every phone seems to have a utilitarian brushed metal or flashy, shiny design, the white model of this phone is a refreshing change. The looped edges (which are very akin to the Lumia Windows Phones) and small size of the device offer the perfect dimensions for one handed operation without performing a balancing act with your fingers. The 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly loops into to back of the unit which offers a unique feeling IΓÇÖve never experienced. The phone also does a great job of catching the light in interesting ways and it's been the first phone IΓÇÖve used that has literally turned heads when walking down the street.Build:Many people have been really harsh on this phone for having a plastic rear. While it is true that it can be easily scratched, I think Sony has gracefully addressed one of the biggest complaints of their previous lines while keeping true to their design aesthetic. Let me explain: the two predecessors to this phone, the Z3C and Z5C both had glass panels on the rear of the phone. While elegant and more scratch resistant than plastic, the phones were prone to spontaneous cracking, even while in a case. Sony could have gone the route of using a metal back, but at the cost of poor reception or having a plastic chin (like the Xperia XZ), but it would go against their clean slab design language theyΓÇÖve retained for the previous lines. As someone who has always used his phone with a case or a skin, having the plastic back is not a problem for me.Another pain-point with this phone has been the lack of waterproofing that the Xperia line has become iconic for. After seeing videos online of people verifying the waterproofing and testing for myself, I can confirm that this phone is in fact waterproof. I canΓÇÖt make any claims for the actual ingress rating, but IΓÇÖve been able to use my phone in the shower everyday since purchasing the phone without problems. My theory is the Sony omitted waterproofing as a an on-paper feature for this phone because it new that labor costs of repairing warranty claims for the device would not be cost effective for the volume sold to the US and UK markets, where larger devices reign supreme. If that isnΓÇÖt evidence enough, the X Compact in Asian markets have the waterproof rating where smaller phones are more popular and where Sony has more resources to make warranty claims.The final pain-point IΓÇÖve seen with this phone is the fact that the US version does not have a fingerprint scanner. It does indeed have a fingerprint scanner, but because of a patent conflict with Hewlett-Packard, Sony had to disable it for the US markets. If youΓÇÖre willing to get your hands dirty with android development, you can actually download and install the signed, UK firmware of the phone to enable the fingerprint scanner. As a plus, since the firmware is official and signed by Sony, you will not lose your warranty if you conduct the procedure. And what a fingerprint scanner it is. The scanner is extremely accurate, placed in the perfect position and unlocks my phone before I even I can even pull it out of my pocket.As for the rest of the phone, the device has the signature dual front facing speakers that are a huge improvement from the Z3C speakers. They wonΓÇÖt wow anyone with their loudness, but theyΓÇÖre perfect having crisp clean audio for sharing media with friends. The camera button is always welcomed and has a tactile dual click to allow focus lock before capture when taking pictures. The volume controls, on the other hand are in an awkward place. Sony has a tendency to place the volume buttons close to the camera shutter for use as a zoom keys, but IΓÇÖve noticed that I more often than not pinch the screen to zoom in so I would love to see those keys moved to the upper-left side of the device.Display:This is hands down one of the most gorgeous displays I have ever used. IΓÇÖve held this phone up to a Google Pixel (which has an AMOLED screen) and this device can go toe-to-toe with the PixelΓÇÖs Brightness and Saturation despite having a LCD panel screen. It's absolutely incredible how beautiful the display is. The colors are juicy and watching movies on the device is. That being said,unfortunately because it is an LCD panel it cannot achieve the absolute blackness that an AMOLED screen can. For me, itΓÇÖs not noticeable enough to bother me but I can see how that could be an issue for people coming from AMOLED devices.Many people have been hyper-critical of the fact that this phone uses a 720p display in 2016. A 720p display is perfect for a display this size. iPhones have had similar resolutions for years without any complaint. Here is a comparison with the current gen iPhone handsets:iPhone SE: 4.0inch Screen at 1136 x 640 (320 pixels per inch)X Compact: 4.6inch Screen at 1280 x 720 (319 pixels per inch)iPhone 7: 4.7inch Screen at 1334 x 750 (326 pixels per inch)Yes, you can get Android phones with 400+ pixels per inch, but why have a screen that is more demanding on performance and battery life if you canΓÇÖt even discern the individuals with the naked eye? Sony has realized this and chose the optimum screen for the form factor.Performance:Many people have criticized the fact that this device uses a Snapdragon 650 Processor instead of an 820 like its big brother. I think Sony chose this processor for a couple reasons. The smaller resolution of the X Compact means that similar rendering performance can be achieved with a scaled back processor. The 650 is also more power efficient than its big brother, which allows it to achieve the ludicrous battery life that the Compact line is known for. Yes this phone might not have the same raw performance numbers as some of the other top of the line phones on the market, but I have yet to experience any hiccups in any applications IΓÇÖve tried. And at the end of the day, isnΓÇÖt that what really matters?Photo-Quality:This is still one of the primary reasons why I buy Sony phones. Sony devices have one of the most powerful imaging devices for android - if you know how to dial in the settings. The 23 MP Camera allows for fidelity IΓÇÖve never been able to achieve in any phone IΓÇÖve tried. The camera app has all of the controls youΓÇÖd expect from a DSLR, but in a compact size. One of the biggest improvements from the previous camera app is the ability to control shutter speed now. Also, compared to the Z3C, the automatic mode is much better at finding the right settings for the current scene. Handheld and low-light pictures are also much clearer thanks to the new laser auto-focus and improved capture speed. I can speak for the camera all day long, but IΓÇÖll just attach some pictures so you can see for yourself.Battery Life:This is the most battery efficient smart phone IΓÇÖve ever used. My usage habits typically involve using GPS and streaming music on my way to work, checking social media, news and dating apps throughout the day, photo taking in the afternoon and casting media in the evening. I would consider myself someone with heavy use with the exception of playing 3D games. IΓÇÖve been able to go from 8am to 10pm with over 40% battery left without any active battery saving features.IΓÇÖve always been a huge fan of SonyΓÇÖs built in battery saving features. IΓÇÖve tested the device with Stamina Enabled for the full duration of the battery and a more normal usage pattern, and it is a breeze to get up to 3 full days of use. If you want to stretch it even further, you can turn on Ultra Stamina Mode which turns off all your apps sans the basic. With that mode enabled, my phone has predicted that it can go up to 2 weeks.Software:SonyΓÇÖs build of android is almost entirely stock save a couple of power saving features and some bloatware. SonyΓÇÖs own included apps have varying degrees of use. Sony makes one of the best Album apps IΓÇÖve used but things like LifeLog, Xperia Lounge and WhatΓÇÖs New I could do without. As for the third party software, Sony actually includes some useful ones including Amazon Shopping and Swiftkey. Luckily if there is anything you donΓÇÖt like, you can easily disable any apps you donΓÇÖt like.Accessories:One of the biggest downfalls for the device is the accessory support. Two things I usually buy when I get a new phone are a tempered glass screen protector and a Ringke Fusion Case. Because of the negative reception to the phone and low volume, many of the common accessory manufacturers have elected to pass up this device in their production line up. In my attempts to find a screen protector, IΓÇÖve been unable to find any that have a complete adhesive hold to the entire screen; the screen protectors either omit the curved edges or screen protectors that only attach from adhesive on the edges, leaving a noticeable air gap between the screen and protector. Thus, IΓÇÖve had to resort to using SkinomiΓÇÖs screen protector in the interim. Unfortunately Ringke does not have any plans to make their Fusion case for this device, but I was able to find the MicroP TPU case which achieves some similar design aesthetics as the Ringke cases.TLDR:Pros:- Beautiful design- Small form factor phone- Beautiful display- Fast fingerprint sensor- Unofficial but present waterproofing- Insane battery life- Great cameraCons:- Very little accessory support (Cases / screen protectors)- Activating fingerprint sensor requires some tinkering- Volume buttons in an awkward location for use with volumeVerdict:The Xperia X Compact is one of the best options if youΓÇÖre looking for a small form factor phone with an excellent camera and battery life. This phone does have its fair share of nuances that make it less approachable than offerings by Samsung, Xiaomi and Google, but with a little work you can turn the device into an absolute pleasure to use.","3","helpful"

"Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)","Sony","329.99","4","This phone is great. I love it. There are some issues with it though. Sometimes the WiFi won't connect even though there is Wi-Fi present. The solution to this is to restart your phone. This could be cumbersome to some. Not all of the phones have this issue but it's not just my phone that had this issue. You're playing Russian Roulette trying to get one that doesn't. The phone also Response a little slow sometimes when you try to turn the screen on. Nothing major. It really isn't that bad. Lastly, snapchat doesn't use the camera to its full potential. The camera is great. I love it and have no problems with it. I just feel that the quality of snapchat pictures aren't on par with pictures you take with the regular camera app. Just the issue I have with the phone. It would be nice to have more memory. 16 GB isn't good enough when the phone takes more than half of it to function. You can buy a memory card to expand it which is great. Overall I am still pretty happy with this phone. Not a bad product considering the price you get it for. If anyone has any questions I did not answer contact me and I will be happy to help.","3","helpful"
"Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)","Sony","329.99","5","This phone will not disappoint! The first thing you'll notice is the size and beauty of this phone. The sleek design along with the metal frame makes this phone an attractive one. The 6"" full HD screen delivers sharp and clear picture which is perfect for watching videos or flipping through pictures. The sides of the screen curve right into the edges seamlessly which is pleasing to the eye. The front-facing camera is incredible. It even has flash for selfies taken in low-light conditions. Rear-facing camera is no slouch either. The speaker is as loud as most smartphones go but nothing too impressive. The ability to add more storage via the micro-sd card slot is a great touch since it only has about 11GB of usable storage. This phone fairs well with high-end phones and for half the price too, great value!","3","helpful"

"Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked GSM IP58-Certified WaterProof Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera and Dust Resistant - White","Sony","129.95","5","The last phone I had was an HTC G2, so pretty throwback. This is a much welcomed upgrade and I was always a fan of Sony phones before. This is my first in their Xperia line and it's looking good so far. I didn't want to go to big with a 5"" screen so I settled for this and it's perfect. The display is very crisp and bright. Yeah the viewing angles could use a little work but I'm not the one to care much about that. The nice 13mp camera on the back is very nice, producing sharp images and good performance overall. The front camera on the other hand is a sad little .3mp which I couldn't understand. Everything else about this phone is high end except for that. Fortunately, I don't take a lot of selfies but if you do, look elsewhere. Performance is snappy and is in line with today's modern phones. Battery life is amazing, especially paired with their power saving features as well as having changeable batteries. The waterproof works superb as long as you secure all the ports and the back plate. I'll be interested to see what else comes down the Xperia line but so far so good.","3","helpful"

"Sony Ericsson K790a Phone (Unlocked)","Sony Ericsson Mobile","26.5","4","I've had this for about a week. It replaced a Nokia 6682 Smartphone that I'd had for about 6 months. Overall, I think this a nice phone with a great tiny camera.Keys/Physical Feel - It fits nicely in the hand and is quite small. I'm not that happy with the keys. The joystick seems to be overly sensitive, and I have trouble hitting the right keys while text messaging.User Interface - It has a relatively snappy feel to it. Sometimes the main menu takes just a second to load up, but maybe this is the keys being unresponsive. It has the normal SE interface -- which is probably an industry-best for non-smartphone phones.Camera - It's pretty great! This is what I bought the phone for -- so it would allow me to have a decent camera with me at all times. The lens cover is a little flimsy but infinitely better than nothing at all. The camera is not that responsive, but the pictures turn out great.Phonebook - Good! Has tons of entries, is easy to use. I wish it would do full name searching, rather than starting with only the first name or the last name but I guess that is a smartphone-only feature for now.Connectivity - I'm bummed that OS X's iSync does not support this phone yet but I'm going to assume that it's just one update away since SE phones typically have very good iSync-compatibility.Sound - Good quality. I have not heard any complaints. One quirk that will take getting used to is that the charger and headphone use the same port, so if you want to talk and charge the phone you will need to daisy-chain them together. My third-party Cingular car charger lacks this daisy-chain functionality.","3","helpful"
"Sony Ericsson K790a Phone (Unlocked)","Sony Ericsson Mobile","26.5","4","The phone features of this unit are good though the volume is not quite as loud as I'd like (my Nokia is much better). Reception is excellent, bluetooth works pretty well. The camera takes good pictures for a phone but it will never replace a decent point and shoot digital camera with 3.2MP or above. The clarity of the display is really excellent and above average. The MP3 player is definitely well above average in sound quality. This phone does so many things so well that it almost gets a rating of 5.My main gripes are with some really important things. The keyboard's feel is poor with the keys too close together. The joystick works great when new but degrades if used for more than basic functions, like playing the provided games. The camera lens cover and buldge is not great but never really bothered me that much. Really the joystick is a feature I'll never have in another phone because it's just not durable and D-pads work just as well.I now use a T-Mobile Dash and it excels at many things the k790a stumbles on but does not offer the same level of sound quality nor close to as good a camera. It is more useful for work, surfing the web and dealing with email and really makes the k790a look like more of a toy (but a great one) in comparison. The k790a will be for sale soon.","3","helpful"
"Sony Ericsson S500i Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP Camera, MP3/Video Player, Memory Stick Micro Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Mysterious Green)","Sony Ericsson Mobile","115.55","4","Switched to prepaid minutes with T-Mobile and researched to find I could buy an unlocked phone with SIM card (didn't like any of the T-Mobile phones available). Must purchase a SIM card to use with this unlocked phone.This phone is quite cool, except for the fact that the screen could be larger. The randomly changing screen saver is a beautiful, along with the mysterious side lighting. Very fun. The phone has an AWESOME mp3 player; with supplied earphones your music sounds like a symphony. Without earphones the music is loud enough to hear but is tinny (as usual). You will need to purchase a Sony memory stick card, which is different from the familiar micro cards we are used to in cell phones. Without that you have little space for mp3 files. The Sony memory is limited to 2gb but is enough for me. Purchase the Sony micro stick along with the phone from the same seller to save on shipping costs...The camera takes nice pictures and videos, and even has a feature to turn the photos landscape, which is good because the screen is rectangular. Really a beautiful, sturdy phone.However - after purchase I discovered that prepaid T-Mobile offers no data plan to access the Internet unless you purchase their Sidekick phone - which is no longer sold on the T-Mobile website at all. So, this Sony phone has many great apps and free games from their website that I am unable to access because I have no Internet capability with T-Mobile. Sony also does not let you download any apps or games through your home computer...must be directly through an Internet connection to your phone. This phone will take and send video and picture messages and text messages though. Just think everyone should know of this limitation. I thought I did all my homework but somehow missed this when researching prepaid cell phones. You can sync up to your home computer to transfer picture, video, and mp3 files, which is quick and convenient.Sony customer support was nice and helpful. T-Mobile support is off-shore but helpful, although time-consuming.Would probably love this phone better with a different service provider where Internet was available through a data plan, but I will keep the phone because of the other positive features.","3","helpful"
"Sony Ericsson S500i Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP Camera, MP3/Video Player, Memory Stick Micro Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Mysterious Green)","Sony Ericsson Mobile","115.55","1","Well, the love affair is over. I did not require much in terms of a phone, beyond making and receiving calls and texts. It did that. The main outstanding feature of this phone is the constantly changing, beautiful and seasonally appropriate graphics. Now, all that is gone and I can not read the screen.Unfortunately, about two weeks ago, I noticed a little blemish on the screen (it looked like a scorch mark). This deepened into a dark patch, obscuring any display on the upper right hand corner of the screen. Then last night, the screen went almost completely dark and nothing I have tried restores it. There is a very faint glow (maybe 5 % visibility) so I can't read texts nor the numbers in my address book, or caller id.I am very disappointed. For the money, I expected these features to last.","3","helpful"
"Sony Ericsson W810i Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP Camera, MP3/Video Player, Memory Stick Duo--International Version with No Warranty (Black)","Sony Ericsson Mobile","99","2","It's a shame Sonyericsson decided to mark this phone with the walkman logo as it has the crapiest music playback capabilities i ever seen. I bought this phone cuz i liked the idea of having a cellphone, mp3 player and digital camera in one small device however the music playback has a very anoying hissing noise which makes listening to music at low valume levels almost imposible. If you like blowing your eardrums off you may not notice this but if you preffer to listen to your music at lower levels you will be very disapointed. This is a problem which purtains to every W810 model, sonyericsson is aware of the problem and admitied that they are not atempting to fix it. Don't get me wrong the phone as a phone works well and the 2mpx camera is just okay (you can't expect super images from a lens that small). But if you are looking for a good phone with mp3 playback capabilites there are a lot of better products out there.","3","helpful"

These people are based in NYC, and I'm in California, so there's obviously an integrity issue here. I've seen other Americans say the same thing about other unlocked GSM world phones purchased from this company.

"Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 Unlocked Phone with 3G, 3.2 MP Camera, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)","Sony Ericsson Mobile","199.99","5","I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PHONE! The phone is sleek and it stands out in a crowd. It is a conversation piece. At least until the X2 debuts:) I like being different and this phone fits w/my personality.BATTERY: I heard there were problems so let me tell you how I dealt w/it. I got the phone and charged it per the instructions. I then let the battery die completely...which it did within 1 day. I charged it and let the battery completely die again. After 2 full charges and draining the battery twice, the life of my battery improved exponentially. My phone can now go 3-4 days using internet, panels, and regular usage.PROS- I love the panels but found the spb mobile shell (which is free) is really the only panel I need. The facebook panel gets some usage as well. I'm going to try the spb mobile 3 and the phone suite and see what it has to offer. I really love all the customizable things you can do with this phone. The spb panels add alot to the X1. I love the Oxford Italian language download which allows me to learn Italian on my own. The battery life is not an issue since I did the steps mentioned above. Connectivity is not a problem and the programs run flawlessly. I love google maps and used it to find my way home after getting lost. It was a life saver since I was in another state. I have had no problems w/the camera or taking pictures. I found that by using mobile windows device on my laptop, I can go into my phone & storage card and put pics, music and anything else where I want it to be including making new folders if needed. Making videos has been fun and the quality is great! The picture quality is amazing w/ or w/o the flash.If you are going to get the phone get the spb mobile shell...it brings the phones best qualities to light and puts them at the touch of your finger w/o tons of searching. I LOVE THIS phone. I haven't registered this phone on the AT&T network but haven't had any dropped calls. That says alot since some of my classes are underground where lots of people get dropped calls. The only deadspots I experienced were in the backwoods of Tx somewhere between Houston & Hooks. But I've been told the moment I register my phone, it'll be on the 3G network and will work in more places. The phone shows I am on an ""H"" network. The sound quality is good.CONS- For most people the price is a con but since I keep a good phone for 6-9 years, it is not overpriced. It does not have yahoo IM. I hate that there is no ""vibrate during appointments"" profile like the HTC Touch Pro because I have to remember to turn off my phone when I go to class. You cannot turn off the SMS notification for sending messages which can be annoying. You can only see the weather for 1 city and the forecast only goes to 4 days. It only has 3 alarm clocks to be set. The font is small but it can be changed using the spb free mobile sheeHowever, I think most of these things can be fixed w/spb downloads (weather, travel, time, diary, etc which are mostly available for a 15 trial period). The keyboard is a little weird at first. It actually hurt my fingers during the first week on use. The keys are almost flushed w/the keyboard and the keys are kinda small for my big fingers but after a week these become minor, if noticeable, points.I'm not sure if I covered everything about the X1. If I can think of anything else, I will definitely write back. I'll write another review after the trial period has ended for spb mobile 3 & sbp phone suite.This phone is worth the money and is AWESOME!!!!! The cons aren't and shouldn't keep anyone from purchasing but beware...the X2 is on its way:)","3","helpful"

I've had it for 10 months and I don't doubt it would last for a while still. I'm really hard on my phones and this one has stood the test admirably. I've dropped it a lot and it's taken the shock quite well, and has never frozen or gotten slow over the time I've had it either. I would say that the hardware has some small design flaws, the thin area on the case near the lock and volume buttons has bent and made the buttons hard to use for me. I've damaged the phone quite a bit though this would likely not occur for most people. It does also seem to overheat easily and I found myself taking off the case when playing games for any extended time frame.The battery life leaves a bit to be desired, it's not bad and it lasts a long time when the phone isn't being used heavily. It seems that the battery life has gotten a little shorter over time too. There is some software that you can't remove and isn't necessary for most people, but that comes with almost any phone. I used mine on the T-mobile network and I did notice that my service got weaker after changing to the unsupported (by T-mobile) phone, but I can't say for for if it's the compatibility or the phone itself that cause the problem. I would lose data service completely when going inside a building, but then when I attempted to make a call suddenly the bars would re-appear, kind of odd. I found the camera to be satisfactory, it gives you a lot of camera options and produces decently high quality pictures for a phone.Overall I'd say the phone is good for the price, but not anywhere near the best on the market.","3","helpful"

The screen is lovely, and the overall speed of the phone is excellent. You can update it to Android Marshmallow out of the box.It's surprisingly manageable, for the size, also, and I've found the battery life to be perfectly acceptable, if not amazing. It's better than the 1st gen Moto X it replaced. Also, it charges super fast (unlike Oneplus 2, which has no fast charging, despite its fancy USB C port...). The home button doubling as a notification light is also nice, in my opinion- a pleasant surprise. The software is almost stock Android, with some minor changes.The camera is quite nice. It doesn't always take great indoor shoes, but Bokeh mode is very fun, and looks great, in my opinion. While I wish it had OIS, the camera software is quite robust. There are a ton of settings that you can tweak.Heat has not been a problem (despite the 810s reputation). Especially with a cover on it, I'm not even noticing it getting warm under normal use.Only negatives so far: The top speaker (the one that you put up to your ear) has the cutout on the right side of the phone, meaning that, if you center the earpiece on your ear, the sound is low. You have to put the right side up to your ear to hear clearly when holding in your right hand, and vice versa. For someone who wears glasses, it means that the phone bumps into them when in my right hand, which is a minor annoyance.Also, I wish the camera button was two-stage, so that it would refocus on demand. (Still, a double tap launches the camera, and the automatic focus is pretty quick, so that's something).Lastly, there are some minor software annoyances. The clock has the appearance of stock Android, but it's baked into their weather/clock widget, and seems to be stuck at version 3.1. I just disabled it and installed the Google one from the Play Store, as I prefer to use WeatherBug anyway. Also, the notification light wasn't enabled by default, so I had to search for the setting to turn it on.There are other things that I could count as negatives but, given the price, I think they're acceptable (no fingerprint scanner, no SD card slot). To me, the Oneplus 2 loses to this phone at this price, due to the lack of QHD screen, fast charging and NFC, as I believe phones for payments will only become more common over the next year.","3","helpful"

So unless your carrier happens to be AT&T, do not count on getting any data with this phone. This is a common problem with phones unlocked by a third-party.

And she was right because the display isn't that big, the rim is about 1 inch and if you use to work with a full display the bottom is annoying and the speaker didn't work that well (the other side couldn't hear you clearly) I think it was a glitch of windows 8.1.

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","Alcatel","129","3","Decent phone for the money, but if you are used to flagships, prepare to embrace the lag. The UI lags severely even with hardly any apps running.Pros: - Screen. Very bright and colorful 1080p display. - Speakers. JBL audio working great. Plenty loud - MicroSD. Great to have. Allows apps natively installed to the card. Great feature with only 16 GB on board. - LTE. Grabbed LTE on ATT no problem.Cons - LAG. SOOO BAD! sent it back within a few hours of getting it. The Zenfone 2 blows it away in this category. - No fast charging. This might be able to be overlooked, but after having a Nexus 6 and the Zenfone, you get spoiled by it.Overall if you can deal with the lag and sluggishness, it's a great phone. I don't game on my phone as I have a tablet, which is why I tried this phone thinking it can do daily tasks fine but the UI lagging just got to me. I think the culprit is it only being clocked at 1.5 ghz, even the lower end zenfone @ $199 is 1.8 ghz. for $50 more, go with the Zenfone 2 with 4gb of ram and 64gb on board. Yea, the speaker sucks on the Zen, but the display is still pretty good and it runs so much better.","4","helpful"
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","Alcatel","129","4","First let me tell you that I spend a lot of time reading reviews and on tech sites and am usually the guy in the family that everyone asks for tech advice.After my Nexus 5 screen shattered I was not happy with the state of any of the higher end android phones. They were just too expensive and big. SO after much research i settled on the Idol 3 after reading tons of great reviews.DESIGN: The phone is thin and sleek. I quite like the plastic back. It has a nice feel to it. There's not much flair to the phone but I personally like that. Its a little big and maybe a tad uncomfortable to hold because of how thin is it. The front has two front facing speakers, and there's a notification light up front. The tray that holds the sim card also has a place for you to put in a micro sd card.Camera: Right off the bat I have to tell you that the camera BLEW ME AWAY. In auto mode you get some very good images, but the camera comes in full manual mode that lets you adjust ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance. I've gotten some AMAZING images from this phone. Its probably the phone's most under appreciated feature. The camera has other modes, but I almost never touch them.Battery: The battery for me on this phone easily last a day, and with light use will last 2. I can't tell you how nice it is not having to worry if i remembered to pack my charger all the time.Screen: The screen is nice and bright, colors nice and sharp. Its not the sharpest, but its a great screen, and better than most in this price range.Software: The phone comes with almost stock android. The minor changes are generally useful, like letting you restart the phone and put it in airplane mode from the power button (which annoyingly google too out of stock android). Alcatel has not been the best about software updates, but they have been really good about security updates. Since i've own the phone there have been two security updates. This is good! Most cheap phones never even see these.Performance: This is really the only place that the phone falters. Games take a while to open, and if you have too many apps or tabs open, the phone really starts to get sluggish. About once a day I end up closing all apps to release some ram. This generally helps, but sometimes I end up having to restart the phone to get it back. That being said most apps are fine. Apps like facebook or twitter don't have any hang ups.Overall, this phone is such a good value. Except for maybe being a tad too big, and sometimes sluggish performance with more graphic intensive games, this phone is a joy to use. In many ways it best phones costing 3 times as much.","4","helpful"

The zf2 has a more powerful processor, GPU and 2x the ram for $50 more. Even though I'm usually all about specifications on my devices, I don't play graphically intense games on my phone. (that's what a PC or console is for in my opinion) So I'll take the better screen, slimmer profile, almost completely stock version of Android and the dual JBL audio front facing speakers any day over the slight difference in performance.I've seen some reviews of people receiving units with a few annoying problems but I'm assuming those are either factory defects or refurbished units because I've had nothing but good experiences so far with mine.If I had to find something negative to say about this phone, I'd say the power button placement doesn't make sense at all even for a lefty. But the factory software does allow for double tap to wake and the display does rotate 180┬░ in portrait which takes care of the button placement for the most part. The second thing is that I've noticed a few stutters here and there, and considering I came from a note 3 with the SD800, these slight stutters happen so infrequently that it doesn't bother me and I didn't really pay attention to them till I read about it in some reviews. Either way, I'm pretty sure this is because of the software optimization because other SD615 devices run smother. Hopefully an update to 5.1 or even marshmallow will cure this. If not, bootloader is already unlocked, root is her and there's already twrp available. Custom ROMs should be available soon too.","4","helpful"

Out of the box update results in frequent system UI crashes, most notably using apps like Chrome and Twitter. For example anytime someone replies to a tweet. Loaded with a metric ton of Asus apps that can't be uninstalled. Capacitive buttons are fine with me but not back light which make it difficult in the dark and often triggered when typing at the bottom of the screen. The additional bezel make the phone bigger than it needs to be. And button placement, button placement, button placement.

"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black","Asus","189.99","5","UPDATE One week later: Battery Life I only use the phone for work and call if I get them for 4 hours and noticed in my 8 hours of use it in a customized black mode it got me 2 days or 48 hours of battery life before I worry about changing otherwise a 1 1/2 hours of use in balanced mode. In the 16GB model the changer isn't fast changing so keep that in mind. Otherwise in the $200 range best phone I ever got with good call quality in AttGoPhone. In $300 I would got the Alcenel but I could get the 64GB with better and fast changing specs so if sound matter the Alcenel is better but in power the ZenFone2 64GB is better bang for the buck!After my experience with Windows Phone I really wanted to return to Android do to the lack of app support and Voice. So my opinions was to go on a contract with a S6 or a G4 but I didn't want to justify a $650 after the HTC purple tint... So I went to mid range and found and waited for this phone to come out.I was in a budget so I chose the 16GB for $199 which in that price range is some BLU phones but no LTE unless it's the slim one I'm not interested. So for $199 what did I get? A 1080p screen which to my eyes similar to my M7. Big Screen... but I'm okay with my male big hands. LTE by AttGoPhone from my Lumia. (Just switch the SIM Card on to the Lumia with ease.) And a good looking phone.Functions- So far my favorite is the double tap to lock and unlock the screen since the lock button isn't reachable to some.For now this is the best bang for your buck in the mid range segment of phones.

"BLU Studio C Super Camera -Unlocked Smartphone - US GSM- Pink","BLU","99.96","4","Honestly, this is a good phone for the price. The only thing separating it from being a five-star phone is the fact that it only comes with 8gb storage and the 1gb of ram.Yes, you can expand the storage. However, if you turn it on without an sd memory card installed initially (forgot to order mine with the phone), the storage will get eaten up fast by updates to google native apps. I had to do a factory reset after installing the SD memory card, cause there was not enough space to install apps, even after using cleaning utilities.Despite memory expansion alleviating some problems, some apps cannot be moved to the memory expansion (facebook, netflix and such). This still leaves 2gb or less on the phone itself, and once it falls too low, you cannot add more apps.I know it would bump the price a bit, but I feel this phone (and other blu phones) should come with a 16gb version. The android OS (lollipop on native on this) is getting a bit larger each time, and google native apps are growing, causing the initial 8 gb storage to be difficult to work around.The RAM is a similar problem. The one gigabyte of ram is eaten up pretty fast, between the OS and larger apps. If you leave even a couple of RAM hungry apps open, you will notice a slowdown. If you keep apps closed and are not a heavy user, though, it is able to handle the OS adequately.So, with that out of the way, why still four stars?Because it was a hundred bucks, it still has lollipop, and the overall experience with the device has been great. The remarks made are more for BLU, as I believe their phones would be more competitive with a couple of minor upgrades.And I would not mind paying the extra price. I feel others may feel the same.","4","helpful"

"Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White","Samsung","222","3","After having my s4 safely in my possession for years, it finally fell and the screen broke. I was advised to get a new phone rather than having the screen replaced. Although I was sad at the loss (I'll miss you, dear S4), I was also excited that I was obtaining a new phone. I was a loyal Galaxy client because I had been, so far, satisfied with the S3 and S4 I had gotten over the years.When the phone arrived, it seemed to be in good condition, however, I made a discovery that had me regretting having bought this phone... the CAMERA sucks! When I say the camera sucks, I mean it sucks... really bad. Compared with the cameras of the S3 and S4, the quality was not good at all: really grainy images from both front and back cameras with the selfie camera being the worse of the two. No matter how much I tried adjusting the settings, the camera's images did not compare to what I had before. I appreciated the other features/specs but the quality camera I was used to left me so disappointed with this phone I ended up paying a thousand bucks in my currency for that I could not give the phone the 5 stars I would've given its predecessors.Samsung, I am so disappointed in this product (and in wasting my hard earned money on this phone) that I will try the iPhone next (and I prefer Windows to Apple).

About a 550 hertz processor doesn't sound so bad and it isn't. But that speed is a lie!!! If I were to give an estimate about how fast the phone was, I would have to say 1 hertz processor. No kidding. For example, I go onto an app and when I just press an icon, it says: Sorry The acore. processor is not working right now.That doesn't just happen once. it happens several times and it's very annoying.

"HTC Nexus One Unlocked GSM Smartphone with Android OS, 5MP Camera and Touchscreen - No Warranty - Brown","HTC","69.99","3","I received the phone in a timely manner, and everything was fine on that end of things.HOWEVERThe description says that this will support the 1900 3G band that AT&T uses, which is false. The FCC number on the phone that I received is for T-Mobile. You will only be able to use Edge(2G) from AT&T, and only receive 3G if you are a T-Mobile customer. False advertising. Luckily I will be leaving my AT&T contract soon.The other thing that needs to be pointed out, is that these models are the NEWER models which DO NOT use the superior AMOLED technology. It uses Super LCD (SLCD) instead, which is a dying technology. I was very disappointed to learn this, because my previous phone was an AMOLED, and it's difficult to go back to ordinary LCD. The display is still fantastic, but will not have the better power usage, low heat emissions, and the extremely high contrast ratio that AMOLED technology provides. The only benefit to SLCS over AMOLED is that it's easier to see out doors.Everything else about the phone is perfect. I personally think its form factor is much better than how Android phones look these days (black rectangle). Plus, the trackball is a nice addition.","4","helpful"

"HTC One M7 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Android Cell Phone - Black","HTC","149.99","2","Great phone with a decent but not spectacular camera. The display is one of if not the best on the market. Colors are accurate and pixel density is fantastic. The phone is extremely quick when opening apps and in normal and power use. The battery life is respectable when you use the ""battery saving mode,"" but some days you'll be reaching for a charger at dusk. Sound quality from the headphones is fantastic and accurate. Beats leaves the audio a little bloated, but it's better than past years. The Boomsound front facing speakers are an excellent addition that every phone should take note on.The Ultrapixel is certainly underwhelming. Images look mediocre at best when viewing on laptop size screens and up. 4 MP simply doesn't cut it as the blurriness and softness of images is disappointing when you think you've captured a beautiful image when looking at your phone's gallery. However, the Ultrapizel does bring in a lot of light and takes impressive images in low light situations. My (my wife's is fine, so ymmv) phone is suffering from the purple hazing in darker environments. it's a known issue from HTC and they are working on a software fix. In the meantime, any image I capture in sub par lighting is turned purple.DO NOT buy the black version unless you always plan to have a case on the phone protecting it. Scuffs and scratches display extremely easily on the phone and even lots of ""wear marks"" on the rear. The big downside to this is that the black color is NOT anodized aluminum(some sources say paint, some say dye, others say it's anodized), leaving any scuffs with aluminum protruding through highlighting the fact the phone has received a scratch. This differs from the black iPhone as when that scuffed, the ""inside"" color would still be dark and not stick out like a sore thumb. HTC instead chose to paint the phone black instead of having the color be throughout the phone. They need to have a better coating on the phone to protect the finish.Get the aluminum for the longevity. Black if you don't mind your phone looking ""vintage.""","4","helpful"

The Battery is awesome, I'm a really heavy user, I like playing games like GTA San andreas, and using Social media a lot, but the pre installed battery saver helps utilize every percent of the phone's battery efficiently, and if i'm at like work, where I'm not allowed to use my phone, I can quickly switch to the ultra battery saving modes which closes all the apps, and only gives you access to calling and texting, in 7 hours, the phone can use up to 5% max of it's battery when in that mode, and I can easily switch back to normal mode . The camera is superb and I'm getting all 4 bars on my T-Mobile Carrier in the Boston area which was the one thing that I was afraid when purchasing this phone. There are obviously some minor glitches, but all of them are simply just software glitches, of which I hope an update will come soon. Probably with the new Android lollipop. I would definitely recommend this phone. A phone almost as good as the iPhone 6 plus but with half the price","4","helpful"

"Huawei Ascend Mate 7 Factory Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, White","HUAWEI","299.99","5","This is a superb phone. It is at least as beautiful in design and execution as the HTC one M8 or M9 and also is comparable to the Iphone 6 plus in design quality. It is only slightly bigger than the 6 plus even though it has a 6"" screen and a much larger battery. It is actually slightly shorter in length and about 3/16"" wider and a few mm thicker, and though it's all metal and glass it is not as slippery in the hand as the Iphone. The finger print sensor works quite well, and the cameras are amazing. It works with T-mobile LTE and has great signal strength both for cellular network and for wifi. The only thing that could improve this phone would be front facing speakers. I bought the 2GB/16GB version and it can hold a 128GB sd card as well. It is seamless in operation and scores about 44,000 on the Antutu benchmark app. Plenty fast and furious for me. I love this phone and it's amazing screen and battery life. On an average day I still have 75% left at 5pm if I start the day fully charged. An added note: I have read some reviews of this phone that claim it comes with loads of pre-installed ""bloatware"" but I found the truth to be just the opposite as mine has NONE, zero, nada single useless app.","4","helpful"

I'm not a huge fan of LG's skin but I downloaded a custom launcher and it makes it a bit better. I bought this phone in Feb 2015 knowing it was a year after it's released and I've been very happy with it. I will say that I'm ready for the 5.0 lollipop update (that is supposedly coming in Q2).

There are many charts and quick-guide cheat sheets in the manual which make for easy hunt and peck assistance with phone functions another quality lacking in Sprint.

"Motorola RAZR V3 Unlocked Phone with Camera, and Video Player--International Version with No Warranty (Black)","Motorola","45","4","I work with cell phones all day, so I see a lot of cool phones out there. This phone, while not the top of the line, is certainly a solid phone with a crisp, if low, sound. It's pretty comparable to the SLVR, which I had before this phone. (The SLVR's display cracked.)Like other reviewers have probably mentioned, it is a little wider compared to even the other members of the Motorola line (such as the KRZR or the SLVR), and I have to admit it felt a little delicate compared to the candybar phone - it's probably just my experience using chunkier phones. I equate this phone to the Corolla of phones - it's a solid phone, nice little perks, a lot of people have them, but not the top of the line.I received a British English version of the phone, which is perfectly fine with me, and unlike phones sold in the US, it has a number of different languages available on the phone. (This is a huge perk for me, as most phones in the US only display English/French/Spanish and maybe Portuguese, but the version I received had French, Arabic, German, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish language support.)Pros:- Slimline casing- Proven and popular design- Widely available accessories- Excellent Bluetooth support - buttons are in no danger of being pushed while in handsfree mode if the phone is closed- Wide keys with raised ridges- Unlocked - can be used with any available GSM SIM - even in other countries- Does not support as many low frequencies as Nokia (which gives a clearer talking sound)- Decent speakerphone technology (but not perfect)Cons:- BREW OS - harder to get applications from the computer to the phone- Does not come with Motorola synchronization software- Older OS and less feature-rich than newer phones, even later versions of the RAZR line.- Web key a part of the dialing pad, right above the call key - be careful not to hit it if you don't have a data plan- Low audio signal sometimes - can be very quiet in a high-noise situation.Matter of Opinion:- Motorola menuing system - please note that this system is NOT the one used by U.S. carriers, which normally flashes their own branded menuing system onto the phone (like Verizon).","4","helpful"

"Motorola RAZR V3 Unlocked Phone with Camera, and Video Player--International Version with No Warranty (Black)","Motorola","45","5","This phone rocks! First, it has an unbelievable signal wherever I go. I never have a problem connecting. Also, it is incredibly clear. I can hear the caller and they can hear me. Unlike those ""candy bar"" type phones, this one wraps around your face so you talk directly into the microphone and the person on the other end can hear every word you speak and not hear all of the background noise. I don't know if it has some sort of sound filter on it or not, but it sure sounds great to the person on the other end.Another cool this is how light and thin it is. You barely even notice that it's in your pocket. But the vibrate on this phone is very strong, so you know when you're getting a call.Last, this is an UNLOCKED phone. This is a big deal, since you can hop carriers and not have to switch phones. Also, very cool to have an unlocked phone when you go out of the country and want to make local calls in that country. Just buy a starter package abroad [usually about $10 USD] and make local calls until you use up the card. Way cheaper than trying to make calls using your US carrier.I love this phone!","4","helpful"

You can also view YouTube videos.

"Motorola XT-910 DROID RAZR Unlocked GSM Smartphone with 8 MP Camera, Android OS, Wi-Fi, and GPS--No Warranty (Black)","Motorola","240","4","I've been in use of this device for about 16 days now. I gave this magnificent smartphone 4 stars instead of 5 because of the internal storage deception. To some people it may not be a big deal considering their implementation of MotoCast (I'll come back to that). When I researched the specs, it was advertised to have had 16GB of internal storage not including the micro-sd expansion capabilities. However, I got the phone and hooked it up to my MacBook Pro it stated only 8GB of internal storage. Not a deal breaker but I would have thought something like this would have been stated in a review of some kind. The Andoid system & OS takes up that much space lol? Ok, whatever.I previously primarily used the Nokia N8. The hardware is great in my opinion but the Symbian OS simply can't compare to any Apple or Android OS. There's a reason Nokia joined with Windows. After having the Motorola Xoom for several months I became greatly impressed by the OS. I figured I would check out what I've been missing in terms of smartphone OSs and purchase my first Android driven smartphone. The user interface is pretty easy to get accustomed to. If loading your device with apps is your thing then Market has more than enough. I've found a ton of useless applications but my fair share of relevant apps.The physical appearance of the Droid Razr is definitely a conversation starter. Even the iphone fanboys can't help but ask about it. I've yet to actually take it apart to see how easily the battery can be accessed but that may come in a later review (who knows). The screen resolution is superb in my opinion. If I recall correctly the Nokia N8 has a 3.5"" screen. The difference between that and the Droid Razr is more than noticeable. I've gotten use to the size difference. I've read reviews about this device being difficult to manipulate with one hand. I haven't really had this problem. My hands aren't really all that big but I can hold it single-handedly with no problem.I'm still patiently waiting for an Android version of VLC player. I'm utilizing MX video player on both the Xoom and Razr. They work great with avi files but still has a problem with mkv files. I'm sure I'll continue to have this problem as long as VLC for Android is in production. MotoCast is pretty cool. The setup is painless believe it or not. The streaming capabilities are pretty nice in my opinion. This program is definitely resourceful.The Nokia N8 has a pretty nice camera. The camera on the Droid Razr isn't as nice but the difference isn't that noticeable. I did manage to try out the HD video recording. Let's just say it works well enough. I mean, I would be pretty disappointed if it was subpar considering the price you pay for this smartphone.Overall, I'm pretty satisfied. The design and physical appearance are great. The OS is definitely an upgrade over what I've been use to (and this isn't even the infamous ICS that it's supposed to receive). Would I recommend this device? I sure would. I also recommend you do your research; perhaps on the Droid 4.0, Galaxy Nexus, Note, and iPhone. Then take your pick. At the end of the day you have to ask yourself how much you plan on using this smartphone.","4","helpful"

"Nokia - 106.3 Negro/black Unlocked Dualband GSM 850/1900","Nokia","269.1","3","Bought this to work on the T-Mobile network in the United States because the product description stated: ""This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile.""Although the phone is unlocked, and the bands are similar between the two GSM/GPRS carriers, this Nokia 106 only recognizes the AT&T network. Since the phone doesn't work with T-Mobile, the product description is mistaken at best, and at worst deliberately misleading.EDIT: Changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars because this *does* work on T-Mobile, but only if you are in T-Mobile 2G coverage (900Mhz and 1800Mhz bands), which may not be the case even if you have LTE (smartphone) coverage. If you only have AT&T coverage, this Nokia 106 will need to be turned on in an area with T-Mobile 2G coverage, after which the phone will thereafter recognize even weak T-Mobile 2G signals. Only after performing the above step was the phone able to work on the T-Mobile network.Take note of the procedure above to avoid confusion and angst when trying to lock your phone onto the T-Mobile band.","4","helpful"

"Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)","Nokia","193.5","5","I use my phone for 1-2 hours of phone calls, an hour of email, and maybe a little web and gps thrown in. I charge it every other day. Things that I like are the basic design, sturdiness and quality. Call reception is excellent. I previously had two Samsungs, and always had numerous dropped calls each day. Reliability of radio service is much better now, which is saying a great deal considering I use the least reliable network (begins with ""A""). It comes with a wired headset and I actually prefer that to my bluetooth earpiece. Sound quality is important. The speakerphone works but isn't loud enough in my car or outside.The keyboard is a little cramped and takes getting used to. The dictionary works great and mostly predicts what I am trying to type. You can add any word to the dictionary easily as you type. I have g-mail and I found both the Nokia mail app and g-mail's own app disappointing. The Nokia app doesn't display html messages without opening a separate browser--not good if you want to quickly scan through messages. The g-mail app opens .pdf files within its program, but loses document formatting. You cannot choose to open an attachment with a program of your own choosing (sounds like the Microsoft strategy is growing within the g-camp). I found ""Profimail"" which works great for me. It works more like a true desktop mail client and can update your IMAP folders so you can carry all your important messages with you. You can download attachments to any location and open them with the application of your own choosing (like Acrobat Reader). The mail client meshes well with the Nokia address book. It is totally software worth trying. I purchased it after only a couple of days of trying it out.There's another default screen app called ""Active Notes"", which I thought would make saving documents a snap, but I was again disappointed. Sometimes I edit emails for people. I copy emails, paste and create a document, edit and then send the edited document back as an attachment that can be copied and pasted into a new email. I tried using Active Notes and it would only attach as a .zip file. I replaced the Active Notes icon with Quick Office, which works well and saves text documents as .txt and .doc.For gps and maps, I use Google maps for Symbian. The gps works quickly and accurately. I'm a guy and wouldn't use turn-by-turn directions even if they were erotically whispered into my ear. I just want to find my location and look at a map. While house-hunting recently, I used it to look at the satellite views too. I recommend Google maps and it's free.The browser mostly works well, and I salute any browser that can display modern web pages on a 240x320 pixel screen. I tried Opera Mini, but didn't see anything better, so I just use the Nokia included browser. Speaking of internet, I also use my phone with the included USB cable as a tethered modem. The Nokia PC Suite of software makes that pretty effortless. Too bad the USB cable doesn't also charge the battery. I purchased a separate USB charging cable that adapts to the charging connector on the phone.There are a few little irritating quirks i found. You can briefly push the power button to switch to different modes, like ""Silent"". Unfortunately the default setting on Silent mode is to not alert or even vibrate upon receiving a call. I missed a whole days worth of phone calls because of that one. I later edited the Silent mode to include a vibrating alert. That seemed a little lame to me.When the phone drops into the standby screen it displays the time without the backlite. When you press the home key, the menu displays and when you press the menu key, the home screen displays--Totally backwards.The mute button is right between the volume keys and you can easily mute your own voice while trying to adjust the earpiece volume if you are not careful.The menus are confusing and completely non-intuitive. Trying to find out how to change something like a hot-key can take a lot of trial and error. An update to the Symbian OS is going to be necessary to keep Nokia competitive.The best case I found is from Beyzacases. They are a Turkish company that makes fine leather cases. I received mine within 3 days of ordering from them.Lastly, the fact that it is unlocked (but works best on US ATT networks) is the best feature of all. You will pay half what you would pay for data if you buy a subsidized phone with a contract agreement. When you remain out of contract your carrier's CSRs will treat you with more respect and care.","4","helpful"
"Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)","Nokia","193.5","1","If you're used to Palm or Blackberry business devices, you will likely not enjoy this phone. It certainly looks the part - its hardware and aesthetics are very pleasing; it's slim and compact; the QWERTY keyboard feels good and works with even the chunkiest of fingers, my sausages not withstanding. The battery life is also very good.Unfortunately the good news ends there. The software is dreadful. Firstly you can't load your contacts from other systems because the PC software provided has no import capabilities at all - except you can import `Thumbnails'. Way too many menu navigations are required to do the common tasks such as looking up a number and dialing it. Depending on where you start from, it can take six menu choices to get the phone dialing, the last one being an annoying extra option to make a voice or video call. Setup items are difficult to find. You can't easily switch to Vibrate for example; you have to go through a pile of menus to find the setting. I'm in and out of meetings all day; I need a button on the phone to allow me to turn to vibrate on the fly. Messaging does not thread - so every message is treated as a separate event, therefore you can't see the response from the other person when composing your answers. Some of the shortcut menu choices on the screen are the same as the buttons - rather a wasted opportunity to bring other common features into easy play. The rest are wasted on one time deals that should be buried in a menu somewhere; for example, Setup Email, Setup Internet Tel. Calendar Entries (Calendar Entries from where exactly - not outlook - you can't sync). I've had this phone less than two weeks and am already looking for something to replace it. I will likely go back to Palm. Sorry Nokia, but whoever designed this software doesn't understand the needs of the business smart phone user.","4","helpful"

"Nokia N82 Unlocked Phone with 5 MP Camera, International 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with Warranty (Silver)","Nokia","50","3","There few main drawbacks that really should not be there:1. the battery is really weak: the phone runs out of charge in less than 48 hours withvery moderate usage (no internet, no camera, etc, only talk 15-20 min a day)2. there are very obvious bugs: Gallery application doesn't work at times (just displays 'no images or videos found'). It seems to have problems reading directories with images or videos both in phone memory and on the memory card.3. GPS application (Nokia maps) seems to have problems locating/finding maps, as a result I would have no maps displayed when I need them the most (i.e. when travel and no Internet)4. Automatic screen rotation really leaves much to be desired, and one would think this function should have been solid by this time.Now, I used Nokia smarphone (Nokia 7610) since 2004, that phone had great battery (7-10 days! with same usage pattern), gallery was working without any problems, and no noticeable bugs, always worked really sharp. When I got this new Nokia N82 I expected same level of quality (seeing that standby/talk time have increased according to the specifications). I really have to say that the N82 battery is really not up to theexpectations. I used to not even carry the charger for my old Nokia 7610 even when I went for 4-5 day trips, as the battery was awesome. Basically, I am very disappointed with Nokia N82 as it does not get up to quality that you would expect from $400 phone. With short battery life and key functions not working sharp (like Gallery), this phone is a downgrade for me, not an improvement compared to my old, but sharp Nokia 7610.Having said all that, phone has lots of functions (Wi-Fi, 5MP camera, GPS, etc), but unfortunately you will not enjoy them much as the battery runs out really quick, or they simply sometimes not function right (eg. Gallery or GPS).Another thing (may be minor) is that Nokia Maps seem to require PC with Nokia Map Loader (and Windows!) application to get maps for your GPS, as a result the maps cannot be obtained using your phone alone; I must say this is just outright wrong, one would think there will support for LINUX users, as this is Symbian, not Windows Mobile.","4","helpful"

I go back to Nokia, and now they say there is no such thing as an ""an international warranty"". Summing it up, I'm right now stock with a useless $260 dollar item that nobody wants to be responsible for.Worst thing of all. The amazon A-Z Guarantee is a joke. I filed twice and both times got denied. They keep saying ""you are not eligible for an A-to-z Guarantee Claim because you did receive the item you ordered"".

"Nokia N9 Unlocked GSM Phone with 64 GB Internal Memory--International Version (Black)","Nokia","228.88","4","This phone continues to remain the king when it comes to having a clean, bright interface that is a joy to use everyday. Purely for this, I'd rate it highly. It is sad that in 2013 we still have button based multitasking and app interaction paradigms on Android.It could've used a little more processor power as it lags sometimes. There are also some bugs, but nothing disastrous.I really wish Nokia hadn't killed of one of the phones that represented how the future smartphone should be, something that sits in the background, not taking over your life, yet displays the information you need when you want it (the always on screen, combined with Billboard is killer!) and is a pleasure to interact with.If you want apps, look elsewhere. If you want a phone that does the basics right, this is the one.","4","helpful"

"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)","Sony","173","1","Before I write this review, some history. I used this phone for over 1 year, before this I owned a Nokia N95 for 2 years, a nokia 3650 for 4 years and a nokia 2260 before that. Needless to say, I was a big time Nokia fanboy. I was really impressed by Nokia's innovation, sturdiness of their phones and the ease of usability (and sleek designs some might say). That ofcourse changed after N97. I have one sentence that sums up this phone. It does a LOT of things but does not do anything well. I will go over each of its major components and tell why there is a problem: Camera: By far, the best feature of this phone. This is where Nokia did well. Unlike other phone manufacturers, they did not make a phone which also has a camera. They made a phone + camera. The lens is great and the resolution is great. The quality of pictures and all the available options makes it as close to a real camera as possible. However, I compare it to the camera on N95 and I am less than satisfied. The earlier camera was a lot more ergonomically stable and the lens cover was a lot nicer but I'm not going to complain too much about it. Still, the quality of images I get are a little less satisfactory than N95 and it didn't entirely replace my existing camera. I give it an 8/10Phone itself: The phone interface is really weird. Who sets automatic landscape setting on the phone itself? I go and try to answer a phone call and the bloody thing is trying to reset the orientation. So I have to wait before the image comes back on the phone. WTF! And then there is the connectivity. If for some reason I go out of network and then back in, there are chances it wont connect for a while. While my friend (who has the exact same carrier as me) is enjoying a conversation, I'm still waiting for a bloody signal. It is disappointing when the function like calling and receiving calls seamlessly should be the first thing the phone does. I give it 5/10Navigation: A new feature which was installed after I bought the phone. Good except its not very good when working offline. Kinda sucks when you go out of network. But some genius decided that a navigation software does not need a history! What? You mean I have to type the entire address everytime I add it? What if for some reason I accidentally exit? Re-type. What if I go there everyday? Re-type. Weird! And there is no bell or anything like normal navigation systems to warn you to turn now. Silly. 6/10Music player: First is the sync. If you transfer music via the mass memory feature then you wont see the songs in your list but if you sync them via the media sync feature then you will. I dont understand why there can't be one simple way to transfer everything. Why do you have to keep changing the mode? Also, if you push the back button on the song, guess what! It takes you back to the main phone screen! Hey! I only wanted to go back to the album! No sir! You cannot do that at all! Gets REALLY annoying especially if you are listening to music in the car. 5/10Touch and keyboard: The responsiveness of the touch screen is average. The touch keyboard is again a genius design. Why make the touch keyboard just like the old phones when you had to click on one key 4 times to type ""c"". Isn't that the point of the touch keyboard? The thing appears on a screen! Why not have all the letters of the alphabet there? Every other manufacturer does it. Why are you the only idiots who don't? And then you don't even give people the option. Why Why why? 3/10Memory and operating system: Wow! If there is anything that put the final nail on the coffin was this bit of the phone. Lets talk about the memory first. Nokia says the phone has 32GB memory. To be fair, that is true. If you want to transfer your music, pictures etc etc. Yes, it has 32GB of memory. What they however fail to mention is that there is something called a NAND memory. Which is only 64MB! What is this memory you ask? Why, its only the place where the entire operating system and most critical apps sit! Things like maps, push e-mail sit here. There is no way to transfer them to the mass memory as its called by Nokia. I wonder what the designers of this phone were thinking? In this day and age of all these apps that go on to smart phones, 64MB was going to be enough? You run out of memory very quickly and then are left to try and figure out ways to free up memory. It gets old really quickly and starts impacting your phone performance. The operating system is just the worst thing ever dreamt up. It has so many things wrong with it that I don't know where to begin. First off, finding any of the functions it does do is a full time job in itself. On top of that, it flashes a message every time you are out of network. You can't make it go away I have tried. No imagine you are receiving a call. Since my carrier does not have that capability, a message will flash while the call is coming in that data exchange is not possible. I know! Just let me answer the phone. Nope! It will flash that message for however long and then you can take your call. Combine that with the automatic landscape feature, voila! Its almost a second before you are allowed to answer your phone call. You are a bloody phone first! Let me get to my phone call! And the features like weather and e-mail widgets. Shouldn't they connect to the internet and retrieve your e-mails automatically? They do. For the first 30 mins and then stop doing it. If God forbid you get disconnected from network for some reason, the connection aint coming back unless you start it manually. Genius. Oh yeah, and the phone software crashes a LOT! Requiring a restart almost every day. 0/10Ovi store: When I bought this phone, I knew it wasn't an iphone so I wasn't expecting the app store but it should still work right? Here is my experience, I tried downloading an app and paid for it like a responsible consumer but there was an error while downloading. Guess what happened, it couldn't find my app. THere was no way I could go back and re-download it because it wasn't there! I tried contacting the OVI store. There was no phone number listed. So I e-mailed them. It took them a week to get back to me and they weren't able to understand my problem. How hard is it to send me a link to enable me to re-download the app? I am not trying to get it for free. I've already paid for it (my card was charged). Finally I get someone on the phone who tries to blame my network for it and sends me a download link which I have to use in the next 3 hours or it will disappear. I used the same link over my network without any issues. The problem was with OVI store. (Its even a lame name to be honest). There are a bunch of free apps too which are tried. They are all bad. 2/10Other complaints: I have ranted a lot here and I hope people read this and stay away from this phone. Frankly, I am done for life with Nokia products. I read things about their new n900 phone and saw similar issues with it. Here are some more issues I encountered. 1) My charging port broke. Now the only way the phone will charge is if I put it at a certain angle and connect it to my PC. Wouldn't help if I were travelling now would it? I think its past its warranty period so no point contacting anyone. 2) The mini-SD card is just plain hard to use. The card doesn't pop out all the way so you are left trying to pry the card using your finger nails praying it doesn't break anything. All in all, shows how bad the design is. Whatever was good about Nokia was destroyed by this phone. I paid $650 for this phone and I don't think its unreasonable at that price to expect that stuff works. Not only did it not but the things about Nokia like sturdiness, innovation, design etc that I mentioned earlier, are absent. I am thru with Nokia for good and want to warn everyone before buying a Nokia as it seems they don't want to test their products anymore","4","helpful"
"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)","Sony","173","2","If you are a power user, don't buy this phone.For comparison, i had a blackberry 8800 that I wanted to replace.Bottom line up front: Don't buy it. I'd rather take a risk on the HTC Touch Pro 2 if you can wait for it on your carrier/afford it unlocked. Or wait longer and see what android phones come out.Rather than bore you with discussion of why I originally chose the n97, lets just get into my experiences:Major Issues:1. It no longer receives text messages except when sending. (This is within a month of buying)2. The exchange email sync locks up regularly and normally has to be manually sync'd when it is working. Also, notes doesn't sync at all for me.3. Even if you install everything to the phones 32GB memory, the phones small internal memory still fills up causing the phone to basically lock up.4. I find myself rebooting the phone regularly to get it to work.5. The web browser becomes unresponsive while loading pages (so if 1 picture on the page isn't loading, you can't browse the rest of the page. I find myself regularly waiting for pages to load rather than reading what is already loaded.) Also, even when loaded pages don't scroll around very well.6. The software availability is much less than I expected. Maybe I'm just bad with google, but it seems like most the programs I want are from the US. And US developers seem to develop in this order: 1. iphone 2. blackberry 3. windows mobile. They just don't develop for s60. For some reason I can never fine the European equivalent of the programs I want. Also, very few programs seem to have been updated from s60v3 to s60v5 so even if someone HAS done the software, it doesn't necessarily work on this phone. That includes most of nokia's own software.7. Battery life is not enough to make it through an entire day if you're using it regularly throughout the day. It'll make it if you leave it in your pocket while you're at work, but if you leave it on your desk, (say because work blocks all the websites you want to visit), you better plan to have it plugged in the whole time.8. The call log stopped recording so I can't see who called me any more.9. I have to leave it on vibrate so it doesn't ring at work yet can rarely actually feel it ring. I don't know if it's not vibrating or just so week I can't tell but I miss 100% of the calls I get when I'm not looking directly at it.10. The phone app does not interact well with any other app so you'll likely screw up a call if you're in an app when you get it. Alternately I regularly have trouble actually hanging up. I don't think the red button on the bezel works the same as the ""end call"" soft button.11. It takes at least 3 clicks to do basically anything whether it's run a program, view a contact or pick who to send a text message to. nothing is well laid out.Minor issues:1. All the configuration options are buried, obscured or unavailable. It's a hunt to try and configure anything.2. The Facebook app requires 2 clicks just to tell it 'yes you can connect to the internet' every time you open it. (This is pretty consistent. Everything wants your personal interaction to tell it how to connect to the internet. This is easy: if available, use wifi, if not use cellular. With AT&T there are another 2 or 3 options I don't even understand.)3. The Facebook app stopped loading pictures.4. It doesn't come with a password keeper and all the options are mediocre on this phone. (There are 3 or 4 options but none I consider acceptable. I could do an entire post on whats wrong with the different password keeper options.)5. Ovi Store doesn't let you re-download programs. It knows you've bought them but it won't let you reload them.6. The podcast program doesn't automatically download your podcasts in the background and it doesn't save your spot in them. (However, I found out if you play the podcasts through the music player it will save your spot as long as you don't play anything else in between.)7. The screen does not redraw well8. The music player is mediocre at best. It seems I have to dig down to the song just to play anything. I'd like to hit 'play' and have some random song play. This is an acceptable player for maybe 2 or 3 years ago. Today people expect a reasonably thought out interface.9. The rss reader is built into the web browser and has to be dug down to. Why can't I just hit an RSS app and have my RSS's, updated, at my fingertips?10. Ok, I know below I throw a bone to the keyboard, but it's quirky. I regularly hit the 'right' key on the d-pad when trying to type which sends my cursor to the front of the text, (where I then type half a sentence before realizing it). Also, I regularly confuse the 3 'alt' keys, (which you'll use regularly). This slows me down and causes me to retype a lot. Also, I'll get an 'alt' key locked in place and type a whole sentence in numbers and symbols.11. Just can't find a reasonable game for it. I just want a simple RPG to keep me busy when I don't have a cellular connection but can't find one that will install.12. The cut and paste are very poorly implemented.That said, it's not a completely terrible phone1. In general, all the hardware is good. They've got a decent platfrom, their just abusing it with terrible software.2. I get a TON of use out of the 32gb of memory. It's just like having a 32GB memory stick with you as long as you've got the cable.3. I like podcasts on my phone. If the software was a bit better it'd be perfect. I let them download in the background and then play them in my car whenever I drive, (and all things considered and morning addition aren't on).4. At least it can kinda sync. It brought over my exchange contacts and calendar. That is pretty nice though I'm not sure it's actually sync'ing changes backwards.5. I like the integration between the GPS, the Nokia 'locations' program, google maps, etc. There's even a program to GPS tag your photos.6. The camera takes great photos and reasonable video. Qik is cool for streaming/sharing video online.7. The keyboard isn't bad inherently. The keys are definitely ok to type on.8. Size and feel of the phone are pretty good. The flip up is great.9. The widgets are nice though I don't use the facebook (I had it up for a bit but I never really cared about anything it was showing me) or the weather (the weather has a solid background which is an ugly contrast to most other widgets that are semi-transparent) widgets.10. It makes a great modem for a laptop, whether as a wifi access point or as a tethered modem. That said, I wish the hardware supported WPA because, being at DEFCON this week, WEP is just asking someone to crack it.Hope this helps others avoid a very expensive mistake. I'll probably try and sell it on ebay and go back to my 8800 while I wait for AT&T to get the HTC Touch Pro 2. I just hope it's not crippled in some way.","4","helpful"

"Nokia X3-02 Factory Unlocked Touch and Type GSM Phone - Dark Metal (International Version) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","Nokia","264.1","1","I have read may comments posted here and I can state that I too have suffered from the main issue of this Nokia X3-02. The touchscreen is absolutely terrible. Because of this, which I believe is a factory defect, I am no longer inclined to buy a Nokia mobile just because of the brand name.I wanted a simple but elegant Nokia ""candy-bar"" mobile and not a smart phone. I thus ordered this mobile primarily for the aesthetic reasons; it looks gorgeous and also feels solid. It is extremely well built and has metal cover on its back, which is great. It is also extremely small and fits comfortably and doesn't weigh down on shirt pocket as well.I'd enjoyed this mobile from May 2012 until January 2014 when the touchscreen rendered it useless. I even scoured the Internet and Nokia forums for all sorts of help. Tried factory reset, calibration, software update [and why for this mobile is beyond me-this is not a smart phone, really], and even took notice of extreme temperatures as this touchscreen is apparently having issues. In the end, I am resorted to now either try to sell it [who will pay for it, even not sure if mobile repair-service folks will] or to pay more money by ordering hardware and then repairing myself.I did not drop the mobile or have it squished. It did not suffer damage, including water damage, and I had it well-maintained. So, just one day in January 2014, it started freezing and within a period of about a few weeks, it ultimately was rendered useless.I urge you to consider carefully these reviews before ordering this particular model. Nokia, if you are reading this, you should take note. You might have designed a gorgeous mobile but in the end, it's absolutely rubbish because a vast majority of customers have issues with the touchscreen.Finally, if you really want this mobile, then ask yourself how much you can afford to have it for and for how long a time! If I had know that it'd be ""dead"" after nearly 1 1/2 years, I would not have ordered it.I wish I had read carefully the reviews from Amazon customers before ordering this particular Nokia model.Anyhow, here's the rundown for you:PROS:*Stunning stellar looks and strong sold feel.*Well-built, not flimsy.*The back is metal-cover and that's practical.*Keypad feels solid and comfortable.*Super thin, super light, can comfortably fit without notice in shirt pocket*Concept of ""touch-n-type"" actually makes sense and works intuitively IF the darn touchscreen were to workCONS*UNRELIABLE because touchscreen unresponsive after nearly 1 1/2 years*Factory battery unable to hold charge after 1 yr. I ordered replacement battery on Amazon. Battery does not have great talk time overall is not strong on holding charge*Touchscreen is terrible, absolutely terrible and ultimately will fail so that the mobile will be useless.Because of these issues, I am giving this a 1-star.","4","helpful"

"PRIV by BlackBerry Factory Unlocked Smartphone - Black (U.S. Warranty)","BlackBerry","349.98","3","Bought this for my Wife to replace her Z30 because She wanted a slider and needed a few apps that we couldn't quite get to work on BB10. Well first off let me say that the bundled Blackberry Hub is broken and even after several updates still has problems. Notifications will just stop working for no apparent reason, after some fiddling, removing and re adding accounts it will work again for a random period of time, txt messages will sometimes not even show up in the hub and even when they do you have to compose and reply to txt messages using the android messaging app.She is constantly missing notifications, calls, txts, and bbm messages on this device because the vibrator on the phone is horrible. I bought her a ditto to pair with the Priv so that I could get a hold of her and even it only works with txt and phone calls. Just like every Anrdoid device I have ever used it requires frequent reboots and has issues with app crashes. It is pretty funny that there are android apps that crash on the Priv continually and that same app will run on the Z30 with no issues.Bottom line is for $700 you expect the device to work out of the box and that just isn't the case with the Priv. If you are an Android user and want a slider you would probably be more than happy with the Priv, but if you are a Blackberry user and expect it to be as reliable as a Blackberry you will probably be dissappointed with the Priv.By the time the Wife was ready to throw in the towel on the Priv it was too late to return it so now its Hers for better or worse. Hopefully BB will fix the software issues with it at some point in time and it will be more usable.Other than the Slider form factor and not having to side load or jump through hoops to get android apps running there is absolutely nothing about the Priv that is superior to a standard Blackberry device.We are long term Blackberry users and I have done my best through the years to support blackberry and to try to show people the benefits of blackberry vs other phones but I call it like it is and there isn't enough Blackberry in the Priv. Currently the Priv is a Blackberry in name only, hopefully Blackberry will be able to make it more Blackberry if that makes any sense. I think BB users such as ourselves were expecting the Priv user experience to be more Blackberry than Android and that's just not the case.","4","helpful"

Look for SELLER lower down on Amazon page. Now to the phone, I bought on and went on a trip. The Priv was plugged into car charger while driving. While using Navigation and blue tooth streaming music to the car the phones became terribly hot, I've never felt a phone get this hot ever. I could feel the heat rising from 4 inches above phone with the palm of my hand. When I put it to my ear the first time for a call it through me off it was so hot, it was do-able but un-comfortable. Out of the car, waking up to 100% charge at 7AM and by 9AM the charge was down to 67% with simple web surfing.

Everything was great as is always the case buying through Amazon. I popped in a T-Mobile SIM and a 64GB MicroSD and everything just worked well. So 5 stars.I subtracted 2 stars because there was no indication of what a nightmare the AT&T branding implies. In all fairness, there's no reason why the seller would know this. So I'm hoping to inform my fellow shoppers. The seller did advertise as an ""AT&T Unlocked"" phone, which is accurate. However, the AT&T branding essentially means it's nearly impossible to patch or update the device. Let me be clear: just like with your computer, you need to update / patch your phone. There are too many vulnerabilities, exploits and malware out there for you to just buy a smartphone and use it without ever patching. And unless you're using it with an AT&T SIM, you cannot get ""over-the-air"" updates, which is the mechanism that seamlessly pushes patches to you, like with iPhones. As of October 3, 2016, my device was running Android Lollipop 5.0, which has known security issues, and yet there was no consumer-friendly way to patch it... over the air. At the time of this review, the current version of Android is Marshmallow 6.0.1.My recommendation: if you are NOT a computer geek, DO NOT buy this phone unless you intend to use it on AT&T.If you are a geek, you can search for the firmware updates and download the AT&T branded image (1.9GB), and the USB drivers, and then flash the phone (read: wipe, load new firmware, and completely reinstall everything on your phone).I spent 5 hours last night researching and executing the update and reinstalling / re-configuring the phone. In hindsight, it would have been smarter to buy an unbranded phone for about $250 more and not have any of these headaches. And lastly, I considered editing the firmware update script (it's a very simple .bat or .sh) and removing the check that forces you to use the AT&T firmware, hoping I could simply flash the ""unbranded"" firmware update. All indications are that I will brick the phone if I do so. Is it a scare tactic? Possibly, but I cannot afford to turn my purchase into a paperweight.","4","helpful"

"Samsung Captivate, Black 16GB (AT&T)","Samsung","589.99","5","I'll keep this review short and sweet, as there are a lot of other reviews with the pros and cons. I had Verizon's Droid Eris before this and the phone had only a 524mhz processor and to my surprise the Verizon network sucks where I live. The phone was slow, typing on the virtual keypad was horrible as it would lag and stutter, and everything about the phone was slow. This phone with a 1000mhz processor is super fast, I don't have to worry about killing apps, and the keyboard is fantastic!! Absolutely no lag and the screen is just gorgeous. Call quality has been great and I get great service where I am in AT&T.I wanted to get the Epic for Sprint because of the physical keyboard, but after using the captivate I really don't need the physical keypad. This thing JUST WORKS.(9/14/10)Edit: The GPS is broken currently, but it is a software issue so it is apparently being fixed. Also, when I received the phone I had problems with it randomly turning itself off. I returned the phone to Amazon and got a new one. So far, no problems with the new phone. I did a lot of research on this issue and it appears to be a bad batch of Captivates and not a software issue or an app issue.","4","helpful"

"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","Samsung","29.99","5","I like it ten times better than the Iphone. No forward facing camera isn't a deal breaker for me, because If I wanted to video chat, I'll just do that at home on my computer (when I have combed hair. lol..) I've had windows phones since the first windows mobile os (which wasn't good). Now they have Windows Phone OS; And microsoft has learned from old mistakes.Since the Mango update Windows phone is awesome. I love that It has office in the phone. This feels like a real work phone. The Iphone felt like, well an Ipod with a phone built in. I also love that I was able to add a 32gb SD card to up the memory. (It now has 36.6gbs free.) That means If I so please I can download movies or Xbox live games. :-) I was spazzing out on mirrors edge yesterday with the Focus. :-) & the hd video may be only 720p but it's good enough to make quality youtube videos. And it's flash is better than the Iphones flash.My choices were pay $$$$ for a new unlocked Iphone or unlocked Android or unlocked Blackberry, settle for a cheaper windows phone that only has 8gbs of rom, or get this older focus and upgrade it with the SD card. For less than the price of a used Iphone 3g, I got a factory unlocked phone that can do all the same things, but adds microsoft office, an hd camcorder, and the biggest factor is that this phone asks before distributing all your private user information.Originally I was onboard for an android, then the same day I was going to get one, a consumer watchdog group out of Santa Monica California issued a request to the US Attorney asking that Google and Apple be sued for billions of dollars due to their letting app developers access all personal data on people's phones. That, infact, is how many stalkers were invading celebrity cellphones. I'm not so worried about stalkers, but I don't like the thought of someone being able to hack my info just because I accidentally installed a shady app instead of angry birds. (and by the way even angry birds gets all your private info sent to them via Android & Iphone.)If you want to be in with the cool people and don't care about privacy issues or budget, go for an Iphone or an Android phone. If you want a phone that will do all the same things but won't give free reign to any app developer that wants to hack your phone, and you want to pay $$$ less for an unlocked phone; The Focus is a very good choice. Just remember to get the right SD card. Many don't work, and because people wouldn't read and research to get the right one, many people complained that they couldn't get it working right. Also many people didn't read the fact that the SD card intigrates into the OS, and therefore can not be removed or used to transfere files once it has been intigrated with the phone. Due to so many complaints by people that just don't bother to read the directions, they stopped putting the upgrade slot on the newer phones. That means the newer ones might have a better processor, but you have to go up to the most expensive models to even compete with the space you can have on this Focus i917.I may get another for my lady and retire her no privacy having Iphone. She already wants to trade. :-)Update May 1st, 2013:One month on and using the phone feels totally natural now. I have not lost any calls, had any crashes, or lost any data.Oh and I did replace her Iphone. She loves her Samsung Focus. Before she wouldn't risk her Iphone: she would switch sims and use a cheap flip phone if for example: we went to the beach or were going to ride on a boat or had an amusement park day. But now she uses her Iphone for the beach, flip phone is finally retired, and the Focus is protected & adorned. (^_^).","4","helpful"

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","Samsung","119.99","3","Correction on original comment:On 12/3/12, T-Mobile sent me two replacement handsets. Writing to the Customer Relation Department with relevant documentation was not a wast of time but effective. But, make sure you have sufficient documentation such as package tracking information in such exceptional situation. Although I would still recommend improvement in their software update quality and customer service department to streamline communication and processing of customer issues such that I would not have lost the use of my newly bought phone for more than four months with lots of frustration. I now changed the rating from 1 to 3.-----------------------I think I have the social responsibility to report my experience to potential customers:1. I purchased a new Samsung Exhibit II Smart Phone from Amazon.com for about $200 and it worked fine until a software update pushed to my handset by your company. The software update rendered the handset frozen, unusable. Therefore, if you do own a smart phone tied to T-Mobile, beware of the poor software quality pushed into your phone..2. I called technical support and the representative asked me to send in the handset for a replacement to: 4500 Cambridge Rd, Fort Worth TX, 76155. I sent in the handset via UPS according to the instructions with the order number posted outside and inside the shipping box.3. UPS delivered the handset promptly. Tracking information shows that the package was delivered to the dock of warehouse 07/12/2012 10:00 A.M.4. But, the replacement handset was not shipped to me within 7 business days as promised by the representative who asked me to send in the broken handset. After several calls to the Customer Representative Department and about one month later, the warehouse sent me email saying that no record was found in receiving my handset such that the replacement handset order cannot be fulfilled.5. After even more phone calls to the Customer Service, a supervisor who was relatively fair and honest and confirmed that UPS did deliver the handset to the warehouse. He cancelled the old handset replacement order and created a new order.6. Unfortunately, the order still could not be fulfilled for some unknown reasons. Again, after many phone calls after phone calls, the representatives could not help but asked me to verify that I did send in the handset. Finally, I asked UPS to give me additional proof of delivery. UPS performed an extra procedure called Package Investigation. UPS confirmed that the package was delivered with the name of the person receiving the package in the warehouse.7. As of today, the order was not honored but cancelled automatically by T-Mobile system.Most of the customer representatives I talked to seemed courteous but could not actually be helpful practically. In fact, they could not even keep their promises to call me back when they said they would after their investigation. Therefore, I had to explain the whole story when I called again but connected to another customer representative in the T-Mobile Call Center. Writing to the T-Mobile Customer Relation was also a waste of time. They simply ignored my letter. I think this company calculates that it is more profitable to provide poor customer server or even illegal business practice in certain cases such as replacing a smart phone broken by software update pushed into their customers' phones. After all, T-Mobile is a big company and its management is playing ""Catch Me if You Can"" game.","4","helpful"
"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","Samsung","119.99","4","For one I got this phone as my first affordable smartphone. I did not want to pay near $80 a month for LIMITED data on the networks that work near my house (ex: everyone but Sprint). I was able to activate it for my first month under T-mobile's $30 no contract plan. As a warning..the ONLY way you can get that plan is buy activating the phone online OR buy buying and activating the phone at a Walmart that is closest to you.Like I said this is my 1st real smartphone. I have messed around with some of my friend's phones, everything from the original Droid to the more recent HTC Rezound and Moto Razor. So its not like I'm not familiar with the android family. This is NOT a top tier phone. It only has a single core processor and half the ram of the top smartphones. However it does come with Android 2.3.5 as standard. And when you do have ""4G"" service, the web browsing and app downloading is very quick. The camera is OK and the webcam is not that amazing but they do the job fine. Be warned though the flash is VERY bright.....its far too bright for normal use (its great using the Flashlight app though). This phone can handle all the tasks of the big boys at a fraction of the overall running costs. I would recommend an antiglare screen protector and a case for the phone though. The screen has lost of glare in sunlight and the back of the phone is very slippery. Battery life is goodd though. With moderate use I got 2 days out of it with the WiFi turned on and the screen at around 50% brightness. It can get glitchy when a bunch of the apps are running in the background but nothing a good appkiller can't fix. Overall if you want a good budget smartphone this is one of the best!PROS:Great plan prices1GHz CPU and 512MB ram very nice combo at this price pointQuick for a no-contract phoneVery nice screen (both visually and with the touch features)Not very big or heavyCan take a 32GB microSD cardCONS:Not the fastest phone in the worldCameras are not greatFlash is too brightBack is very slippery and screen is reflective without anti-glare protectorSo far...no ICS update for it without rooting","4","helpful"

I bought this phone because I don't believe in getting stuck in contracts for a phone. Goes against everything I stand for lol. But there are so many pre-installed apps it is a little irritating at first, but if you are computer savvy you can root it with no problems (JUST GOOGLE...the zerg method so far has been the most reliable...I haven't heard of any bricking) then you will have a powerful little machine on your hands. Its gorgeous to me. Very lightweight. There are lots of cases available for it to be customized how you want. I was stuck between this one and another phone but the availability of accessories really helped me lean towards this one. (I am a girl it still has to look good lol.) My boyfriend has the Samsung Galaxy S2 and for the most part they can do the same things. Don't get me wrong his is visually sexier with its gigantic screen and resolution, but functionally its more like its little cousin lol.","4","helpful"
"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","Samsung","119.99","5","I bought the Exhibit II 4G straight from Amazon and I was not sure if the phone was going to accept the Simple Mobile Sim card since it was locked to T-Mobile Prepaid.

I was also able to successfully root the phone using the ZergRush method. After rooting the phone I installed Titanium Backup to remove all of T-Mobile's bloatware from the stock ROM.Since I am using Simple Mobile's $40 2g/3g plan I disabled the 4G to double the battery life.The phone itself is very snappy and the images are very crisp. The front camera works great with Google+ and Skype so you should be able to video chat without any problems. The rear camera could be better since it only has 3.2 MP but with the help of a good camera app you can add filters and enhance the pictures.It is definitely the best 4G T-Mobile or Simple Mobile phone you can buy for under $200.","4","helpful"

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","Samsung","119.99","2","I bought this to replace my G-2 as it was going to cost too much and take too long to get my busted screen fixed. On paper this Samsung was almost identical to my G-2. In practice, this Samsung isn't fit to wipe the G-2's proverbial butt. NO comparison, the G-2 is a worlds better device in every way. This has to be the most ""glitchy"" device I have ever had the displeasure of owning. I am not a Samsung fanboy and this phone provides more reasons as to why I continue to dislike the over-rated Samsung empire of mobile phones. I am constantly drawn back to them by the overwhelming masses that love their brand as well as the media coverage. And true to form, I am constantly disappointed time and time again. Buy this if you have no other choice in my Opinion. The HTC and LG phones have proved to be far more polished than the last 4 Samsung phones I have owned. Just in case someone might be wondering, T-Mobile prepaid phones are no different than their standard phones unlike AT&T and Sprints' prepaid phones.","4","helpful"

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","Samsung","119.99","2","I had the samsung exhibit II for almost a full month before giving up on it and returning it. The actual form factor is nice, very slim and compact. The buttons, particularly the on/off button are impossible to find simply by feeling around for them with your fingers, they are just too flush with the phone. The call volume, at least on my samsung exhibit II, was always extremely low. At max volume, I always strained to hear the person on the other end. Groove IP is not usable on this phone because the call quality is always echo-y, choppy, or static-y - regardless of whatever settings you tweak. Whenever I had the handset up to my face for a call, the phone functioned as though my face was pressing buttons on the phone's dial pad, so my calls were always littered with the sounds of buttons being pressed during the call. I've had better phones. I ended up replacing this phone with a Samsung Galaxy note, which is working out much, much better for me.","4","helpful"

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","Samsung","119.99","1","I initially was really pleased with this phone. Setup was a snap and the phone was fully functional.However, what I found was that it had stability issues. It would often freeze running an app or unexpectedly restart the OS. When it froze, I would have to pull the battery to recover. Usually I had the problem at least once every day or two; but sometime several times in a right in a row it would crash. I installed the ""Gas Buddy"" app after the first week and found that using that app would consistently crash the phone. Being my first android phone, I asked other android users about stability and found their phones ran for weeks or months w/o issues.I found a firmware update on t-mobile site that was supposed to address ""stability"" issues[...] and was able to load it (Android version 2.3.6 / Software T679UVLE1) manually using the Samsung Kies tool (OTA update was no longer available from t-mob); however, it did not resolve the problem. After two weeks; I returned this phone after seeing a lot of similar issues reported on the online forum. Too bad; I really liked the phone other than the stability problems.I replaced it with a Samsung Blaze 4G and although I have only had it for a day I have not been able to crash it; even with the same ""gas buddy"" app that always crashed the Exibit. The Blaze also has a dual core 1.5Ghz processor versus the single core 1.0Ghz processor of the Exhibit and twice the RAM of the Exhibit. I did not think the Exhibit was particularly slow, but the Blaze is much faster on everything and noticeably more responsive running a very similar build of android 2.3.6 compared to the Exhibit.","4","helpful"

"Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- White","Samsung","644.99","5","Excellent smartphone for discerning people who want the very best features and user experience.Comes factory unlocked and compatible with all major US carriers (Both GSM and CDMA) and with complete US Warranty. Zero bloatware. Beautiful silver design looks stunning and will grab everyone's attention. As soon as I inserted the SIM card, it automatically installed all special features from my carrier (Supports Wi-Fi calling & Hotspot from T-Mobile).I bought this device after extensive research to upgrade my aging Galaxy Note 2 smartphone. The Galaxy S7 Edge has arguably the best camera among flagship smartphones, water resistant, excellent battery life, access to all apps and content in Google Play Store, Amazon App Store, and Galaxy App Store. The user interface is very customizable thanks to free and premium themes in Samsung's store and custom launchers. You can extend storage space up to 256 GB via SD Card (Pro Tip: Get the best possible SD card in order to be able to record hours of crisp 4K video footage).If you're on the fence between this and another flagship smartphone (I was looking at the iPhone 7), what will win you over is the amount of productivity and creativity that is possible with this device due to unparalleled multitasking features and sheer computing power. Try doing two things at once on an iPhone and you will be sorely disappointed, maybe Google Pixel is a contender in this department.","4","helpful"

If Samsung found a way to implement stereo audio, it would be perfect, but it makes up for what it lacks in sound quality in its relative loudness and top of the line headphone output. Rest assured that you are buying the best phone on the market right now.--------------------------------Compliment it with a Spigen Neo Hybrid Crystal (I 100% recommend Gunmetal for a Silver Titanium GS7 Edge): http://amzn.com/B01AUORACQand a Armorsuit Case Friendly Screen Shield: http://amzn.com/B01ACXSKAG","4","helpful"
"Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6533 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone Dual Sim - International Stock No warranty (Copper)","Sony","300","3","While the specs look good in paper/theory, the real life performance was disappointing.1. Camera: First let down was the camera. It is hard to believe the megapixel count on the camera. All the pics I took exhibited water color effect with lack of detail, over-saturation with HDR. The front camera took selfies which are grainy. Even the video quality was quite bad. (Check the camera reviews on C4 or M4, the Samsung S3 camera is better than this)2. Screen: 2nd let down is the screen, I may be spoiled by Samsung (previous phone was a s6 edge which I dropped and damaged) but the colors are very washed out, the brightness is not enough for use in sunlight here in Dallas Texas. I have liked LG G3, G4, Moto X pure screens not that I am completely partial to Samsung. But this screen is pure bad even BLU phones have better display. (Go to bestbuy and check out the C4 display you will know)3. Performance: With SD 810 processor and 3 gigs of ram, did not experience any abnormal heating issue (while using gps etc did get a little warm and the glass back made it hard to hold but not a problem if you have a case) or lags. The Sony UI is very clean and close to stock android.4. Software: Upgraded to Android 6.0 and there was no root available for it on xda.5. Battery Life: Battery life was good to OK, better than S6 edge but not as good as the S6 active. Little less than a Note 5 or Nexus 6pFeatures that are unique that made me buy this phone: Dual SIM, 3GB RAM. SD810, waterproof,NFC, 5.2 inch 1080p screen, 21 mpx camera.But the screen and camera alone was a bummer. With this phone there is no wow factor like when I got when I bough the S6 edge.","4","helpful"

"Sony Xperia Z3+ E6553 32GB Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone w/ 23 Megapixel Camera - White (International version, No Warranty)","Sony","359.99","5","Let me start by saying I have owned over one hundred cell phones,more than half have been smartphones .I just sold my Note5 which is a beast in all specs and easily one of the best smartphones ever made.That phone was too bulky for everyday use and I have large hands.I have had about 5 Sony Xperia phones before this one,they were all midrange.Something about Sony's design and aesthetics have always drawn me back to them,I had the Xperia M4 Aqua which felt super cheap and the screen resolution was ok.This Z3 plus is amazing in all aspects.The second I took it out of the box,I was reminded of the M4 Aqua in a visual sense.The Z3+ (mine is black)is a very Japanesque minimalist designed slab.Kudos in my book.Very slick glass back is slippery but so were my Note5 and S6 by Samsung.Why does anyone want a slippery phone??Has an oleophobic coating which I think Is great considering all other Sony phones(midrange) pick up smudges and are impossible to just wipe off first try. The one and only problem I find in this phone is the overheating,It's not uncomfortable to hold but dims the screen and supposedly shuts down camera app(has yet to happen to me).Speaking of the screen,It's super bright and has great contrast.Triluminous technology is awesome.The front firing speakers are not loud at all but I know exactly why,it's the waterproof membrane muffling high output.However,output through headphones and or aux. cord is amazing,Hi Res audio,EQ settings galore,sound effects......this it what I grew up on,Walkmans,CD Walkman from Sony.The phone is at a perfect width for one handed use.5.2 inch screen is just right.Screen to body ratio is decent.This phone is fast too,I've thrown a lot of multi tasking at it and it keeps up with it all,no lags in gaming or browsing.Call quality is just fantastic.There are call EQ settings,I have it set to Bright.The ear speaker during calls is so loud and clear It reminds me of Motorola phones or better.There is also a slow speech setting which slows down the incoming speech during call in real time(other Sonys have this feature too).I am totally recommending this phone.Camera is great but not up there with the flagship Samsung Galaxy line.Does the job though.I love my phone and it amazes me everyday.I get LTE with Tmobile and I am 99% sure it has the ATT LTE bands too.","4","helpful"

Screen is good, call quality is average to good, battery life seems decent so far.The major drawback I have with this phone, and this is nowhere that I found in any of the descriptions online, you have to dig for it, is YOU CANNOT USE MOBILE NETWORK DATA WHILE CALLING. These days this is an issue that is pretty unique to Verizon, and even so there are plenty of phones out there that get around this by having two antennas. This isn't one of them. In the past, I've found the simultaneous data-while-calling to be something I don't need to use all that often, but when I do, I REALLY do need it. And I'm simply incredulous that Sony would release a Verizon phone that doesn't support it. For me, it takes this phone from one I hoped to use for a couple of years, to one that I keep until the contract rolls over.Also irritating, the phone puts up a big warning message about not having data while calling (except on WiFi) when I make a call.

I haven't tested the waterproofing, but it's a useful feature to have.PERFORMANCE:I was concerned at first about the Snapdragon 810 in the device, and heat issues, but so far, I haven't felt any extreme heating. It does definitely get warm during use, but no more than say, a Samsung Galaxy S6. It's very fast, and for gaming, the 720p display serves it well. Some users have reported performance issues or lagging through the UI, particularly when an SD card is inserted, though I've not noticed any of these. I also have had no issues with streaming Bluetooth audio.BATTERY:I don't think this device will last 2 days on a single charge, though it absolutely can get through a single day's use. I spend roughly half of my day in a low signal area, which I expect would affect this, and thus, lower the battery life. In a stronger signal environment, it would probably last longer.CAMERA:The camera is excellent. The photos are crisp, and sharp on most subjects. Low-light performance could be better, but I have no real complaints with the camera.MISC:It doesn't support Wi-Fi calling, or VoLTE on T-Mobile, though I doubt this can be helped, considering it's an international model.Overall, this is the best option if you're looking for a compact Android device. I'm certainly keeping it.","4","helpful"

Unfortunately, it did not end well. I am not going to list how amazing the phone is or the pros, the hardware specs already do. The problems with this phone are that it started to slow down over time because it began overheating. It becomes unresponsive and then apps crash. A separate issue is when it randomly reboots. This is unrelated to overheating. I honestly really like the device, but what's practical about an overheating supercar? Nothing. I remove 3 stars for overheating, software issues, and because they were severe enough that I had to return the device.","4","helpful"

"Sony Z3 LTE - Unlocked (Copper)","Sony","227.43","5","Great device, I was on the fence about purchasing the Z3 because of the phones that were going to be announced at MWC, but figure that in the worst case scenario I could return it. Boy am I glad I didn't wait, the announced phones by HTC and Samsung didn't have anything to grab my interest. Curved screen gimmicks and iPhone 6 ripoffs from Samsung, and HTC just rerelased the same phone they did last year with a higher megapixel camera; one that's just as bad as before. To top it off they all have the same specs which were only slightly better than the Z3 (and as someone who constantly heard ""why do you need a 64bit processor when your phone don't have 4 gig ram lol"" when he had an iPhone 6, it's funny to see android manufacturers pushing them now on phones that still have less than 4gigs of ram)Overall the Z3 has been the best Android phone I ever owned, faster than the m8 I owned before it, same high quality build as the m8 and IPhone, with a camera that can best both in the right hands. The waterproofing is just the icing one the cake. I used to be a fan of Sony Ericsson back in the feature phone days but stop being a fan of them once they start to put out less than great smartphones, but the Z3 has won me back. I still prefer IOS to android, but I am waiting to see if lollipop can win me over when Sony pushes it out.","4","helpful"

To top it off they all have the same specs which were only slightly better than the Z3 (and as someone who constantly heard ""why do you need a 64bit processor when your phone don't have 4 gig ram lol"" when he had an iPhone 6, it's funny to see android manufacturers pushing them now on phones that still have less than 4gigs of ram)Overall the Z3 has been the best Android phone I ever owned, faster than the m8 I owned before it, same high quality build as the m8 and IPhone, with a camera that can best both in the right hands. The waterproofing is just the icing one the cake. I used to be a fan of Sony Ericsson back in the feature phone days but stop being a fan of them once they start to put out less than great smartphones, but the Z3 has won me back. I still prefer IOS to android, but I am waiting to see if lollipop can win me over when Sony pushes it out.","4","helpful"

"VIVO IV Full HD Super Amoled,13MP,(16GB+2GBRAM)-Factory Unlocked (White Silver)","BLU","209.99","4","After more than two years with a Galaxy Nexus, it was time for an upgrade, but I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. I looked at the ephemeral Oneplus One, the BLU Life Pure XL, Moto X, and other unlocked phones before finally settling on this one. For $299.00 it's a helluva bargain.What I like best:1) Double tap the screen to wake the device; tap the on screen halo for screen sleep. Basically, you only have to use the power button to turn it completely off. That way there is no chance of the button wearing out, which happened on my Gnex.2-The screen is BEAUTIFUL. Big, bright, and clear. I love the Super AMOLED.3-Processor speed is super fast. No lag whatsoever.4-It is thin! 5.5 millimeters feels nice in the hand.5-Camera works really well. I'm surprised at the resolution and speed. You can hold down the button and it will snap dozens of pics repeatedly in only a few seconds.What I am less enthusiastic about:1-The battery is not nearly as bad as some people claim. For some reason it does drain down to 80% in a hurry but after that it goes on for a long time. I routinely have the screen for four plus hours straight without needing a charge. That's pretty good actually. However, this battery will need to be charged daily.2-Storage of 16GB is less than impressive. That said I haven't come close to running out. I back up all of my photos on Google Plus so I don't need much space anyway. There is plenty here for most people but I would have felt better with 32GB or more.I'm going to enjoy this inexpensive phone with its lovely screen and impressive specs for a year or so. Then I'll see what's on the market in 2015.","4","helpful"

"VIVO IV Full HD Super Amoled,13MP,(16GB+2GBRAM)-Factory Unlocked (White Silver)","BLU","209.99","3","Let's get this out of the way first: If the centre of attention is where you want to be, the VIVO IV can get you there. This phone is beautifully crafted, I'd say even PERFECTLY so. The fit and finish of the assembly and the quality of the materials used could put Apple to shame. The Super AMOLED display (obviously filched from the Samsung Galaxy S4) is very noticeable in its sleek black frame. If I had to nitpick, I'd say the buttons could be a bit more tactile, but otherwise, the VIVO IV is physical perfection in a phone.How very, VERY sad that it is in the software that this vision of beauty quickly fades to mud. There is constant stuttering and hesitation, especially when opening and closing apps. Since my Xiaomi Redmi Note (which has the same 8-core MediaTek processor and 2GB of RAM as well) is butter-smooth, I have to put this down to BLU/Gionee's poorly optimised software. The launcher and super-deep overscroll bounce are infuriating. And don't get me started on battery life. It is poor, not relatively, but by any measure - an evening of moderate WhatsApp, Facebooking and 15 minutes of photo-taking managed to deplete it by 40%. In fact, this is the first phone in some time which I haven't been able to see through a 12-hour working day. Pity, because my Life Pure XL is the exact opposite in this regard (though it behaves similarly in the software department.)The bad software also leads me to believe that battery life and camera performance/image quality could have been MUCH better if BLU had only made sure Gionee hadn't dropped the ball in the software department. Long story short: there's the potential for greatness in the VIVO IV, but at the moment, it remains just that: potential. At the moment, I'd advise that you only buy this phone if you're willing to accept the not-insignificant software and performance flaws (and, given BLU's update schedule, to accept that these flaws could persist for some time to come.)","4","helpful"

The back of the phone was very hot to the touch. During a large update it would probably shut down or burn out. At the least the life of the phone would be cut way short from the overheating.

I also like muti-exposure, which lets you combine two pictures together. The camera also has other camera modes, but those are the two that I use the most.Audio quality/headphones-Apparently the phone has a chip that makes music sound better. Music sounds amazing on the free headphones provided and in my car through Bluetooth.Battery Life- I use my phone casually. I go through Yahoo News, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and Snapchat about twice every hour from 7 am to 5 pm. Afterwards, I use Nike Running for about an hour, Google Music for about an hour, and finish with around 50% battery life. I personally think that the battery life is really good, but I don't play games or watch videos on it. Only con about the battery is that it takes a while for it to recharge, I guess a 3,000mAh battery takes a while to recharge...Button Placement-This may not seem like a big deal...but I've had phones where they put the power button on top of the phone (WTH?). The button placement on the phone is perfect, at least for me. The volume buttons on the left side, and the power button on the right side are perfect for my hands.Style- In my opinion the phone is really attractive. I got the Ion Gold color, and it looks amazing.Phone Size/Weight- The phone is kind of heavy, but I like it. It makes it feel expensive (Which it kinda is :')). The phone is also really tall, but not too wide. I think that was really smart, because it allows me to use the phone with one hand at least for me.

They need to make the call volume louder, a lot louder.Front Facing Speaker- Not loud.Construction Build- I don't know what the phone is made out of, but it is starting to accumulate a lot of scratches, especially on the top and bottom inch of the back of the phone. I think those sections are made out of plastic and are not too durable at least in terms of scratching. You should probably get a case.Indicator light- The indicator light is white and when you're outside or in a well lite room it is really hard to see if it is flashing. They should have gone with a red/green/blue or anything, but a white indicator light.No Expandable Memory.- You stuck with 32 gb brah.Default Music Player- Looks amazing, but you can't reorganize playlists, WTF!?

It also has great international band support, far better than competitors like the LG G4 and One Plus Two...though about on par with the Motorola X Style and the latest Nexus phones.Unfortunately, the phone is marketed as ""factory unlocked"" but that isn't entirely accurate. When a device is ""factory unlocked"" it should mean that the phone is not locked to a carrier AND it is possible to unlock the bootloader allowing the installation of root and/or custom ROMs like CyanogenMod without having to take advantage of an exploit/security hole. It certainly isn't locked to a carrier...but ZTE have made sure that access to the bootloader is denied.Whilst the unlocked bootloader isn't important to most people, it is important to me to be able to install my own firewall and ad blocker (you can install a limited ad blocker without root but it definitely isn't as good as AdAway). It also means that I can't gift it to my wife's relatives in the future as Android requires root to install custom fonts.

"ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Phone, 64 GB Chromium Silver (U.S. Warranty)","ZTE","339","5","I have been a LONG time HTC user, and have enjoyed my HTC devices. I decided to switch devices after I heard about the Axon, and I was surprised at the advancements in this ZTE device! So much so, I felt a bit disappointed for not having swtiched from HTC earlier! :) The first thing that blew me away was the quality of pictures and videos. I'm not as technical guru, but whatever ZTE has done with the duel cameras is SO much more advanced than my previous HTC device. The camera focuses instantly, in low and bright lighting. The pictures are so crisp and clear, even when blown up in my display I see no distortion. (Amazing that I'm reviewing a camera, as if I purchased a camera, but I purchased a PHONE!) When I activated my phone, from what I can tell thus far, it operates just as you would expect from a normal android operating system. As far as the operating system, I'm not seeing anything different in this device vs my HTC or my husbands Samsung. The screen size is perfect. I think my husbands Samsung is just a bit too big, this AXON fits my hand perfectly so the screen ideal. The quality of screen is just as good as his Samsung or my HTC, so any playback that I have seen thus far is just as good. The sound coming out of this phone is far superior to the Samsung device my husband has, but comparable to the HTC device I have with front facing speakers. The battery is much better than both the HTC and the Samsung so far as well. I really just can't say enough! I am so pleasantly surprised as I expected something that might be perhaps slightly less in quality because the cost is almost half of that of the Samsung, iPhone, or HTC. You can imagine my excitement to find that not only is it just as good as the top end devices I've used in the past, ITS BETTER!!!

"ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Phone, 64 GB Phthalo Blue (U.S. Warranty)","ZTE","379.98","5","I have been a LONG time HTC user, and have enjoyed my HTC devices. I decided to switch devices after I heard about the Axon, and I was surprised at the advancements in this ZTE device! So much so, I felt a bit disappointed for not having swtiched from HTC earlier! :) The first thing that blew me away was the quality of pictures and videos. I'm not as technical guru, but whatever ZTE has done with the duel cameras is SO much more advanced than my previous HTC device. The camera focuses instantly, in low and bright lighting. The pictures are so crisp and clear, even when blown up in my display I see no distortion. (Amazing that I'm reviewing a camera, as if I purchased a camera, but I purchased a PHONE!) When I activated my phone, from what I can tell thus far, it operates just as you would expect from a normal android operating system. As far as the operating system, I'm not seeing anything different in this device vs my HTC or my husbands Samsung. The screen size is perfect. I think my husbands Samsung is just a bit too big, this AXON fits my hand perfectly so the screen ideal. The quality of screen is just as good as his Samsung or my HTC, so any playback that I have seen thus far is just as good. The sound coming out of this phone is far superior to the Samsung device my husband has, but comparable to the HTC device I have with front facing speakers. The battery is much better than both the HTC and the Samsung so far as well. I really just can't say enough! I am so pleasantly surprised as I expected something that might be perhaps slightly less in quality because the cost is almost half of that of the Samsung, iPhone, or HTC. You can imagine my excitement to find that not only is it just as good as the top end devices I've used in the past, ITS BETTER!!! I would have ZERO hesitations to recommend this to any and all of my closest friends, (and strangers like you all!) :)","4","helpful"
"ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Phone, 64 GB Phthalo Blue (U.S. Warranty)","ZTE","379.98","5","Overall a very solid phone especially for the price. I did a lot of research before I bought this phone, and I don't think you can find anything better for around $500.PROSThe front 8 mp camera- It takes really good pictures, especially selfies.The back 13 mp camera- I really like bokeh mode, which lets you refocus pictures you already took, its pretty cool. I also like muti-exposure, which lets you combine two pictures together. The camera also has other camera modes, but those are the two that I use the most.Audio quality/headphones-Apparently the phone has a chip that makes music sound better. Music sounds amazing on the free headphones provided and in my car through Bluetooth.Battery Life- I use my phone casually. I go through Yahoo News, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and Snapchat about twice every hour from 7 am to 5 pm. Afterwards, I use Nike Running for about an hour, Google Music for about an hour, and finish with around 50% battery life. I personally think that the battery life is really good, but I don't play games or watch videos on it. Only con about the battery is that it takes a while for it to recharge, I guess a 3,000mAh battery takes a while to recharge...Button Placement-This may not seem like a big deal...but I've had phones where they put the power button on top of the phone (WTH?). The button placement on the phone is perfect, at least for me. The volume buttons on the left side, and the power button on the right side are perfect for my hands.Style- In my opinion the phone is really attractive. I got the Ion Gold color, and it looks amazing.Phone Size/Weight- The phone is kind of heavy, but I like it. It makes it feel expensive (Which it kinda is :')). The phone is also really tall, but not too wide. I think that was really smart, because it allows me to use the phone with one hand at least for me. I think I have slightly larger than average hands.Not a Popular Brand (At least in the US)- I like this because that means that I won't run into someone else who has this phone. Its kinda exclusive, like the OnePlus one, only that this phone is actually attractive (at least to me).CONSCall Quality- This is a big negative. I mostly just text people, so it doesn't bother me that much, but I think this could bother a lot of people. I have Metro PCS, so maybe its just them, but I had trouble hearing people I called. They need to make the call volume louder, a lot louder.Front Facing Speaker- Not loud.Construction Build- I don't know what the phone is made out of, but it is starting to accumulate a lot of scratches, especially on the top and bottom inch of the back of the phone. I think those sections are made out of plastic and are not too durable at least in terms of scratching. You should probably get a case.Indicator light- The indicator light is white and when you're outside or in a well lite room it is really hard to see if it is flashing. They should have gone with a red/green/blue or anything, but a white indicator light.No Expandable Memory.- You stuck with 32 gb brah.Default Music Player- Looks amazing, but you can't reorganize playlists, WTF!? So, you have to use Google Play...which isn't bad...but the one that comes with the phone is much better...but you can't move the order of songs in your playlist...so I don't use it :(No Finger Unlock Scanner- That would have been cool.","4","helpful"

It also has great international band support, far better than competitors like the LG G4 and One Plus Two...though about on par with the Motorola X Style and the latest Nexus phones.Unfortunately, the phone is marketed as ""factory unlocked"" but that isn't entirely accurate.

It certainly isn't locked to a carrier...but ZTE have made sure that access to the bootloader is denied.Whilst the unlocked bootloader isn't important to most people, it is important to me to be able to install my own firewall and ad blocker (you can install a limited ad blocker without root but it definitely isn't as good as AdAway). It also means that I can't gift it to my wife's relatives in the future as Android requires root to install custom fonts. Rightly or wrongly, at least one country uses non-Unicode compliant character mappings which won't change for a while (the worst part of this is that iOS has allowed custom font installs since iOS 7 without jailbreaking!).In early August when this phone arrived it was the best option on the market.

And the phone IS a workhorse -- no dropped calls, and I could barely tell the difference between the old phone and the new one when it arrived. It is VERY sturdily built. That said, the replacement phone ordered from Amazon was unlocked and worked great. I just popped in my old SIM card, charged her up, and was up and running. Just be sure to allow plenty of time for the initial charging of the new battery. It took all of overnight, with the phone turned off, to get the full initial charge.

"ZTE Z Max 2 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Black","ZTE","119.88","5","So, my lonnnngg nightmare is over. If you have read my other phone reviews you understand why. This is the 4th phone I purchased for myself on the past 14 months. I didn't want to pay for a high end phone so I tried several. The ZTE is the best of the Androids so far.The screen is very nice, not great, but hey its a phone. Its a little smaller than the Lenovo I had and that is a mild downer, but not a biggie. My larger fingers have to pause before typing but your results may differ as they say. I had read some reviews on the ZTE ZMAX2 in the past and they were favorable so I bought this one.The sound is very crisp and easy to hear even driving thru the carwash.It is an ATT go-phone but was unlocked for T-Mobile. Response times on the net have been terrific unlike my last two phones.My mild dislike is I wish it had a bigger screen but all in all, I am pretty happy with this. Stay tuned I will update my real world experiences in the next few weeks.Battery life at this point appears to be good.UPDATE 3-26-16Great phone ! only one minor complaint. (see my other phone reviews). Battery life is very good. Sound is good.My ONLY complaint is I can't root the phone (for all you techy types there is NO root software I can find that works). There is a lot of AT&T crap on the phone but who cares...Charged my review to 5 stars based on actual usage.","4","helpful"

"Acer Liquid M220 Windows 8.1 Smartphone - Black","Acer","34.95","1","First off, great service as usual. I wanted a small Windows Phone and had seen this phone at the MS store. I liked the look, and thought it would work. First off, there are no directions for inserting the SIM card. Why would you need directions you ask? Because after ten minutes of dinking with it I realized that SIM1 on this phone is a ""full-size"" SIM card! Who has those anymore? So, I had to put my SIM card in the SIM2 slot. When I did that, every call I made required me to select SIM2 over SIM1. Also, it was taking way to long for all my apps to load. Ridiculously too long. But the nail in the coffin for this phone was the screen. It's awful. You have to tilt the phone just right to see the screen clearly. Just a little angle from any direction and it like your looking through one of those PC security screens from the 80's. One other reason I was interested in the phone was the textured case; I thought it would be easier to grip. Not. It's slipperier than the smooth case on my Lumina 635, which I'd use all the time if it had a front facing camera. Anyway, if any on you know of a good Windows phone with a 4"" screen I'd appreciate your feedback.","5","helpful"

The screen is just amazing, the best screen I've seen on a phone. It's vibrant and bright (even in bright sunlight). I really hope the next version has more RAM and a better camera. The current camera is good but nothing to write home about. It's definitely better than the nexus 5 (2013) and the moto g and it's not fair to compare it to flagship phones. The speakers are ridiculously good (stereo too!!). It comes with JBL headsets, which are way better than the other standard headsets you get these days (if you're lucky to get one that is). The screen size is great. The next model should definitely have quick charge, a bigger battery (even though the current one lasts almost 12 hours on medium-high use and at 70% brightness, this includes watching videos, listening to music a lot and reading articles every hour). The SD card is a huge advantage, seriously this phone is a winner. Also, the most important part, it's pretty much stock Android!!! Which is really the star of the show here. Would recommend this to anyone interested in a good phone.","5","helpful"

After 5 months of use I can say definitely say that this phone is a huge disappointment.The Idol 3 has a nice big 1080p display which looks great, 2 GB of RAM, a decent processor, slim sleek design, and a mostly bloat-free stock Android OS. Unfortunately, the software is horribly unoptimized because this phone suffers from lots of performance issues. Lag when watching videos on YouTube, blurry pictures with the camera, and apps taking ages to open up are some examples.I had my phone bricked when trying to take a system update so I set up a warranty repair on their website and overnighted my phone to Alcatel. Only to have it returned to me 3 days later unrepaired because my phone had ""water damage"". My phone has been in a case since day 1 and has never been submerged in or splashed with water. Clearly they don't want to honor their warranty.Pair that with the fact that this phone rarely gets patches and will likely never be updated to Android 6.0 and I recommend paying a little more for a Galaxy, LG, or Nexus phone.","5","helpful"

I have had several Blu phones but they seem to be quirky, never get upgraded to the latest operating system and their customer service is bad.I discovered that this Alcatel was a unlocked smartphone and gave it a try. I was impressed as soon as I opened the box! This phone has a 5.5"" screen, same as my old phone, and felt great in my hands.The reception is great and I usually get an LTE signal out here in the corn fields. The JBL speakers are outstanding! They are placed in the front of the phone, one at the top and the other at the bottom. It is great hearing bass when streaming a movie. The only problem with the speakers is that I can not get them turned down just one more notch. The lowest setting is pretty loud and I have tried all the sound settings in the phone. This is my only pet peeve.The phone updated some Alcatel settings as soon as I turned it on then updated its self to Marshmallow right afterwards. There is very little bloatware which is great. You can add a mini SD card and you have a choice between leaving it as is or you can have the phone include the mini SD card into internal memory. You can have 32gb plus what ever you add with a mini card. I added a 32gb mini SD card so now I have 64gb of internal memory.This phone also has NFC which can be used in many ways. Very few smartphone in this price range have NFC.For the price and features, this Alcatel can not be beat!","5","helpful"

The box was not sealed and the plastic on the screen was clearly removed and reapplied. There was hair underneath it. I attempted to exchange but I was only offered a return option. The phone was sent from Alcatel so this is no fault of Amazon.The phone itself did seem to have a bit of a lag to it. I see that a lot of reviewers blame this on the specs but It's obviously something in the Alcatel skin. I'm sure a simple OTA could solve this issue. I really had no problems with the double tap feature. It worked every time for me. The screen is very nice for a $250.00 phone. It's very bright and it has very nice color. The speakers are the best feature of the phone. The sound quality of the speakers is very close to my M8. Surprisingly, the headphone jack was rather weak. I didn't try the JBL headphones but my Klipsch headphones were not that loud. My Zenfone 2 has much better headphone output.I would have liked to at least liked to try the phone for a week before giving a review but I couldn't get passed the fact they sent me a used product. I returned it after using it for an hour. I think with root and a vanilla ROM, this could be a decent phone. It has a pretty good build quality and the screen and sound beats high end flagships. It's a shame Alcatel sent me used equipment.","5","helpful"
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","Alcatel","129","5","I will start by saying that I buy the majority of my electronics and phones from Amazon because I'm too lazy to do research for the best possible price. With that being said I literally stumbled upon the Idol 3 pre-order page and said what the heck. 199.99 what could I lose. Well last week when I received it I was stunned by what I got. This phone specs may not be jaw dropping but the way it's all put together is amazing. The signal reception is great. The camera is great. The app load times is great. Overall you cannot go wrong by giving Alcatel a try on this one. Sure they make budget phones but this in my opinion is far from a budget phone.

My household spends hundreds if not thousands on amazon purchases annually. I'm not a product review sort of guy. I typically just read through everyone else's comments to determine if a product is worthy or not. Amazon reviews have rarely steered me wrong. In this case I must make an exception and share my experience with the Alcatel one touch idol 3. I love everything about the phone.....except the quality of screen materials. It scratches, and I don't mean a little. I have had all types of phones over the years. Flagships to burners, but I have never experienced such a scratch prone one as the Alcatel. I ALWAYS use a case, but have never bothered with a screen protector since I am very careful with my electronics thus the screens remained pristine. I was very proud of my new bargain phone with flagship specs....until I noticed multiple scratches appear out of nowhere. They are increasing as well so the only possible conclusion is the phone was scratched by pulling it in and out of my pocket...seriously! Nobody else touches my phone, no kids, no pets, no nothing. Well the damage is done, I will put up with it I suppose as the other features of the phone are amazing. You have been warned, good luck my fellow shoppers!","5","helpful"

Consider this rating a scale from 1-3 stars and I'll explain why. Depending on what you are looking for in a cell phone, the rating will go up or down. At least this is what I have seen in other reviews. I'll cut to the chase:PRO1. SPEAKERS/JBL Sound system is AMAZING. To the point that music played on this thing out plays my lap top speakers! Believe it or not. You are carrying a mini boombox. Alcatel gets 5 star is this area. They can be too loud nonetheless so please be careful and considerate or you are going to sound like that person in a relatively nice SUV with a so so speaker system that rattles.5. Look is okay. My friend thought it was an I phone or something more expensive/high end. The phone is super light.2. Screen resolution is okay. Not 4k but c'mon it's HD. I am sorry to hear reviews from people that have received defect units.CON:3. THE DOUBLE TAP FUNCTION IS ALMOST NON-EXISTENT. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS AN ALCATEL OR SOFTWARE PROBLEM. Most likely something to do with the device. All of these 4 and 5 stars received excellent/polished devices with no problems, which I find really hard to believe. This is annoying. You will just have to use the power button to turn on and off.6. SIM CARD DID NOT READ APPLICATIONS I HAD BEFORE AND OVERALL PHONE INTERFACE CAN TAKE TIME TO TAKE USE TO.6.5 I don't think Screen is scratch resistant.7. PHONE CAN BE SLUGGISH WHICH IS ANNOYING!!!. I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS FROM A $250 DOLLAR PHONE. I HAVE AN OLD LG F6 Metro PCS phone and with all honesty, I don't know which is slower or faster at times. Some applications stopped working all together and I had to uninstall and install again. WTF<---!!! Really.*Caveat. My employer subsidized 50% of the cost which meant I only paid $125 out of pocket for this cell phone. BUT I am trying my best to be objective here and I can also say that I would not have paid $250 for this phone.which brings me to item number 8.8. coverage with AT&T drops randomly!!!!!!!. I DON""T CARE HOW MANY #1 or #2 STAR REVIEWS THIS PHONE HAS ON AMAZON. THIS along with the laggyness of the phone dropped this review from a solid 3 to a 2 star. A ONE STAR DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY BOOK OF REVIEWING. I was hesitant in rating this a 2 or 3 star but this made it clear. I am not crying about having 4gLTE 10000% percent of the time but when you can't hear someone because your bars just drop when other phones don't drop signal *in a good area with good reception (this statement compares other cell phones in the house) Just doesn't make sense.*second caveat. I don't pay for monthly service or service at all. BUT STILL, I WOULD NOT WANT TO PAY FOR SERVICE JUST TO HAVE A GOOD LOOKING TOY PHONE WITH GOOD SPEAKERS. NOPE. SORRY.This would be a better choice if the presale price of $200 stayed or if it was less because this is what this phone is worth. IN MY OPINION!!!9. CHIPSET and ram are a bit below mid range in terms of specs. Nothing great to be honest especially when we are entering the age of 3 and 4 Ram cell phones with Snapdragon chipsets in the 800 range and Melta kits etc.10. Battery life, at least in my case has not been impressive. I don't know if it's my device or what. But I have been using this phone not to slightly and not to heavy and it appears that the battery drains rather quickly compared to most of the reviews here and online that are boasting about this phones battery life.11.5 Phone gets warm to the point of hot near the camera when in use. Not even using for hours. Just using. This is alarming. Not sure if this is normal but again not cool.12. I don't know yet if I want to hassle and buy another phone and send this back, get my money, etc. Even though Amazon seems to do well with returns.13. I wonder if anyone else has this similar dilemma? Did anyone return it, get their money back and bought another Alcatel or something else?14. I hope my review helped someone out there. Go ahead and buy it, but please read some of the other reviews. Seems like some of us got a bad batch? Maybe. Go try your luck. this could have easily been a 3 or solid 4 star. I don't know about a 5 star. I am being honest but I am also picky. I did a lot of homework before getting here and even then I had some doubts. Guess you never know till you have one in your hands.

A major feature is that the phone will accept up to 128GIGs of a mini memory card. I use this large memory to hold music, audible books, pictures and large spreadsheets.

Phone streams MLB.TV on the LTE network with no issues which was one of the main things I was hoping for.

The screen is very vibrant and looks amazing.Cons: Like to pocket dial a lot but I heard Android is famous for that with emergency calling. No Camera button on the sides, I was very accustomed to it on my Nokia Lumia 925. Only 2 pages for shortcuts to apps, not sure if that is able to be changed or not. The double tap screen isn't as responsive as my wife's Sony Xperia.

It seems that it made matters worse because at the time,\the phone started to self hard boot on its own. extremely frustrating when you are on an extremely important call.I had hard reset the phone twice at the time because at the time the phone didnt want to function properly.I contacted Asus and informed them about it.I started to bump into people who own this phone and they have mentioned that they was going through problems with their phones as well.Moving on today July 12 2016.My phone is again unstable and have to hard reset the phone.It seems that even though the phone is 90% charged, when I disconnect my Anker battery pack from the phone, the phone goes into Black screen and does not want to function.Even though the phone is 90% charged it does not want to come back to life UNTIL I plug in my Anker battery pack again.I Re - hard booted the phone TWICE today on July 12 2016 and the phone does NOT want to act properly.Its completely unstable and only works when it wants to work...... Now im at the point where im pissed off now.I spent nearly 400 dollars on a phone which I thought I was going to enjoy for a long time.and it seems that ive been getting nothing but headaches with this phone...Android Marshmallow OS has been release for about 8 months now and currently the new Google Android OS is now Android Nougat (N)and ASUS has YET to release an OS update....!!Everyone I have talked to tells me the same thing.... they are waiting for an update as THEIR phone is not OS stable either...Marshmallow fixes a lot of things in the OS but ASUS wont release an update, even though there has been 3 MAJOR OS release updatesASUS for some odd reason wont just release an update.Im a bit pissed off and angry now...... my phone is not acting as it should and its acting funny.and I cant seem to get through to ASUS for them to release an update to Marshmallow v6.1......Grrrrrr.I was on the phone with a realtor about an apartment, and the phone decided to self hard reboot itself for no reason.It did it again when I took a picture of the apartment putting me in a serious bind on something extremely important.....I was also talking to a second Realtor that day, and my phone decided to completely hang up and self hard Boot ...in total the phone did it 5 times in 5 different occasions that was extremely important to me.I WAS planning on purchasing Zenphone 3 Deluxe and Zenpad. - But now I do NOT trust Asus any more.I will most likely purchase a Samsung Note & a Samsung Tablet next time.....So far Asus is letting me down. - I can not trust Asus enough to risk spending my hard earned money on the v3 of their phone.I would rather buy a Samsung, a company that keeps their devices up to date.I will not recommend anyone to buy this phone at this time..... Asus has screwed me over several times since i purchased this damn device....im really unhappy right now...","5","helpful"

"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Black (U.S. Warranty)","Asus","235.16","2","Update 5/21/2016:After almost a year with this phone I have to change my review, guess I let myself go with a new toy and rated to high. I will start with the good, the pictures and video are fine, I like the screen, it pretty much handled any app with ease and fast charging, now the bad and the reason of deducting 3 stars, the update to Android 5.1 still doesn't happen this is big let down for me because Asus has hinted for a long time that the update is coming instead we get some software updates that only touch their added apps that I ended up not using at all, just the ones that help extend the battery life and that takes me to one major let down, battery life is horrible I cannot make it to the end of the day without charging the phone by 6 pm or so, what good is it to have 4GB of ram when you have to constantly clear it because it kills your battery, then the power button is awkward and hard to use, tap on screen has become non responsive and the phone is uncomfortable to use unless you use a case (edges to thin and to heavy), I am careful with my stuff and I have dropped the phone a couple of times at most and from a sitting position and always with a sturdy case protector and glass screen protector, the back cover broke! it's still usable but the damage is visible and I think it happen by removing it to install extra sim, you don't do this often but is a pain to do compared to other phones, USB cable broke after 6 months and lastly the phone shape makes it hard to use in other accessory like VR headset, tripod holders and so.Not recommended and waiting for a better option, looking at you Moto G4 plus.","5","helpful"
"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Gold (U.S. Warranty) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","Asus","225","5","Asus has shown the industry how to design and manufacture a powerful device at a very affordable price. I spent several weeks looking for a replacement phone (Galaxy S4). After reading many reviews and watching a variety of reviews on youtube I placed my order. I could not be more pleased. This phone is without a doubt one of the most powerful smartphones on the market and you will not be disappointed. Yes. the back cover is plastic. However, like me, you're going to put a case on this to protect it and it simply won't matter. Despite being plastic, the back cover fits snugly. Many of the reviews outlined a dim screen. Candidly, it's fine. The second big concern I read about was bloatware... well, show me a phone today that does not come loaded... What most reviewers fail to tell you is that you can delete / remove whatever you want. So far, every app I have installed has worked perfectly. Every feature of the phone has worked very well. The battery life is great. I get 24 to 30 hours on a charge consistently, and I use the phone... This has been such a great phone I purchased a second for my daughter. Asus is great... they have released three updates for the phone which installed perfectly. So, bottom line, I would challenge you to find a better deal feature for feature from any other well known manufacturer. Purchase one, you won't be disappointed.","5","helpful"
"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Gold (U.S. Warranty) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","Asus","225","5","Bought it two days ago and it worked great, right out of the box. The two updates took minutes. The ASUS UI isn't that bad that I might stick with it a bit longer before switching to Google Launcher. I agree that the camera isn't the best compared to my Note 2 that I have, but I knew that before buying and it isn't all that bad, especially with all of the different modes I got to play with. I am using Cricket wireless with it and it's working great. No issues with the 4G LTE/4G data connections. It's quick, responsive, and has a nice feel to it. Only gripe I have is that removing the back cover is near impossible for me for some reason and I am afraid to continue to try to remove it for fear that I'll scratch it (although I think the people at Cricket may have scratched it already to install the sim card). All in all, it's a great phone at a great value. My husband liked it so much that I will be ordering him one too. (This review is for the 4gb ram phone)","5","helpful"
"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Gold (U.S. Warranty) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","Asus","225","5","Great phone. Super powerful, fast, great resolution, lighting fast, and my battery life isn't too terrible. I've cycled it a few times and the battery life keeps on getting better.UPDATE: 07/05The 2 points mentioned below? Asus update fixed these issues! :-)Some trickery: If you are a LINE user, if you send a emoji, your keyboard will stop working. Solution? Close the app and reopen.Some trickery (2): Vine user? Video will play once, then crash. Grrr...For $300? I'm blown away. This thing is more powerful than my $600 laptop. Incredibly easy to use interface, lots of versatility, and I'm ESPECIALLY loving the rounded back! Whoever thought it would be brilliant to make the back of all phones flat is stupid- with this rounded back you're actually cradling the phone rather than holding it by it's edges. If you're an android user you'll feel right at home with this.Update: 07/05Using this phone for a few weeks now, and I have to say, even with a moderate amount of usage, I can get by 2 days without having to charge the phone. With heavy usage, 1.5 days. I cycled the battery by letting it get down to 10% or so, then charging it up. This lead to me having to charge the phone at odd times, however, the battery life is superb, unlike what others have reported so far. I've also found that using a glass protector + a case = No dice. You need to use a plastic screen protector, or else the sides/power button area -will- lift. This was frustrating since I bought a premium tempered glass protector that I had to remove after 2 weeks.Another thing that needs mentioning. It may be because of a hidden setting, but if you are on wifi and send a MMS (picture or video content), at least with T-Mobile, the MMS will NOT send. You need to turn off the wifi. I've read up on this, but still have yet to find a solution, even though I've browsed though all of the settings... It may be a carrier thing, but I find that doubtful. Also, this device sometimes has issues with connecting to certain routers. My work router is fairly new, but the phone will not connect to it always. Has not been an issue at home however. A third thing is that keyboard support, while vast, does not allow users to change the layout. If you are a multilingual person who uses East Asian languages, in my case Japanese, you are limited to the traditional keypad- no QWERTY support :'(I do believe the only way to bypass this is to install google/3rd party keypads, which is kind of frustrating since the phone already has the support built in. Anyone? Correct me if I'm wrong, lol.Within the next few weeks I should have a new update on using it outside of the US. So far, best $300 I ever spent on a phone. Vastly better than anything else I've used so far when given usability, options, and price in comparison to Samsung and Apple.","5","helpful"
"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Gold (U.S. Warranty) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","Asus","225","4","This is a great ""budget"" smartphone, because it's more of Asus's flagship, and it's got a lot of power and storage for the price. In terms of pros, you get a 1080p screen, 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of storage for only $300, and the performance of the processor (x86 as opposed to the standard ARM in most Android phones) holds up well to some flagships. However, the phone does have a few shortcomings such as a weirdly blue saturated screen calibration (there's a built in app to adjust color levels), mediocre battery life (stems from the Android 5.0 memory leak bug, which Asus will probably fix in the future with an update, and is partially fixed if you use Xposed), and a lot of bloatware (which you can freeze/remove). It does take work to make this a better phone, but the dev community seems to be growing, and Asus also says that they are working on a 5.1 update plus bootloader unlocks which could mean custom ROMs and recoveries in the future (source: Asus forums).","5","helpful"

Unfortunately, I hate this phone! The price is great, and the features are fantastic, especially given the price. The battery is the problem! It started having trouble around the three month mark -- sometimes it would not charge, or would deplete rapidly. I thought it was me not closing out apps or forgetting to fully seat the charger. This got progressively worse until at the six-month point, it will no longer hold a charge.One of the advantages to ""non-apple"" devices has been that they have removable batteries. This phone does not. The battery is poorly manufactured and is not easily replaceable, so it will die somewhere during the warranty period, but you will be unable to replace it.Worse yet is the warranty. Asus is nowhere to be found, the seller does not provide contact info, and Amazon will not handle the return outside of 30-days. You will be stuck, with no one to stand behind the product.","5","helpful"

"AT&T Motorola RAZR V3 No Contract Quad Band GSM Camera Cell Phone Pink","Motorola","26.99","2","I bought this phone because I always wanted a razor and i really like flip phones. Not big on touch screens. And the Razr is just one of the coolest designed flip phones. I had to have it. The phone came on time and was well package. The reason I gave it a 2 was because of these reasons. The side buttons for volume and voice record are very loose. Almost feels like they are going to come off. The cover over the front screen on the outside was coming unglued. The battery cover had dents in it already. And the keys are also coming unglued. Gluing the cover and keys back is not a big issue. But this phone was supposed to be brand new. It was more in used condition. The biggest problem right now is the screen will go black and not come back on. I've only have used this phone for a total of 3 weeks. I have to take out the battery and restart it all over again. And the screen doesn't always come back on. Takes a few tries. It was working good until this. If it didn't have all these issues I would have gave it a 5 star rating. So if you want one of these phones be careful when you buy them. Your taking a risk.

It's a very nice phone in appearance, but when I assumed it would be ""unlocked,"" I thought I would be able to use it on my network. It's a Verizon phone and I'm running on T-Mobile's network. This phone doesn't stay connected to T-Mobile's network all the time. It's constantly searching for GSM and I'm in ""SOS"" mode more often than not. Plus, it doesn't run on 3G, only EDGE. It's very, very frustrating when you realize your phone hasn't rang for a while, you look at it and realize you cannot get calls until it finds the network again -- which sometimes can take a long while. Also, on occasion, the phone just stops working to the point that you cannot make and/or receive calls. It will ring, shows as being connected, but you cannot hear the other party. I searched online for a solution to and found one that suggested I press ""#"" when making and/or receiving the calls to make it work. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT! I should be able to make and/or receive calls on the spot. One last thing: I'm not sure if the keyboard is ultra sensitive, but every time I'm trying to text, I'm constantly getting the symbol. The keys may be too close together. If you're running on T-Mobile or AT&T, do not use this hardware. You'll be frustrated more than satisfied. Go with the 9900! HTH","5","helpful"

Using blackberry Classic, you have to be one of two persons; either an old user of blackberry or someone who is really professional with certain needs. My main concern for using blackberry classic is SECURITY and getting the job done so fast. Encryption is super and easy. Qwerty keyboard is the most interesting experience. For apps fans who are coming from apple or android, this phone is not for you. This phone is for someone who:1-texts a lot2-emailing a lot3-is focusing on business4-is concerning about security and encryption specy after the recent reports about leaking data from hacked icloud and androids.5-is more productive through typing documents and surfing Web for research and other stuff.This phone is NOT for those who:1-want to have a lot of apps for different purposes2-are heavy gamers3-concerns about Camera and photo editing for snapchats and collages (however BlackBerry Classic supports that)4-concerns about watching a lot of movies and netflix5-prefer FULL touch screen than just a keyboard (duh!)Overall, I loved this phone and I am willing to keep it for at least 5 more years.","5","helpful"

Ordered the Blackberry Classic and was very excited to get it and impressed at first glance.

After trying to start the phone it would not power on. I found a Blackberry cable I had around and plugged it in thinking that the battery was just dead. After being on the charger for two hours the phone still would not turn on. At that point I started looking closer at the phone itself and realized that the body had numerous scratches and scuffs and there was dirt build up in just about every corner. I was sent a used phone that didn't even work. Very, very disappointed to say the least especially after paying $350.

"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black","BlackBerry","149.99","3","If your in last place shouldn't you be going faster than the rest of your competitors to catch back up in the race. I wish someone would tell BB that before they implode because I love using BB handsets!!!This BB Classic has a extremely bad flaw that makes it a deal breaker. Let me explain.The proximity sensor (the sensor that disables display while on a call with phone positioned at ear/face to eliminate accidental/unwanted input while on a call) is broke. PERIOD!! When the phone ""on edge"" whether vertical or horizontal the display turns off like it should, fine. But when the phone is flat the display DOES NOT turn off. This is very bad when you are using your shoulder and face to hold on to the device to free up hands to multitask or anything else the device will start muting, adding calls, repeat number taps, and so on. I was on a personal call the other day and knowingly called a client now he thinks I'm crazy. I keep unknowingly putting people on hold and rambling on only to realize later it was a wasted call. This is actually very dangerous as i have been talking while phone put itself on hold only to have that person call back and have the ringtone right in my ear by surprise scaring the heck out of me.There is know logical reason for the proximity sensor to disable itself just because the phone is flat. And it is not a single phone defect as I purchased 2 Classics and they both have the same problems.I also check to see if the happens with my Nexus 6 and Moto X 2nd Gen. Nope the display stays off while on a call even when phone is flat.This is a complete shame because I love this phone but cannot afford to lose business on a so called business phone. Until BB pulls its head out of its own UKW this one goes back.","5","helpful"

"BlackBerry Curve 8310 Phone, Red (AT&T)","BlackBerry","49","5","I've had such a good time already with this Blackberry. If this phone would last forever, it's the last one I'd buy. It's the first Blackberry I've ever owned and I have next to no complaints. Here is my more specific feedback, including some help with AT&T:1. If you're tethered to your laptop through your Blackberry and the internet just seems to lock up, chances are the website either overloaded the system (ex. large streaming videos) or maybe you've even received a phone call at the same time but it couldn't get through. The phone does act as your modem for your internet to the laptop so I've experienced that you can't be online and receive calls at the same time. (See solution for this in my #2). I've even thought to change my voicemail to say something about, ""There's a possibility I'm using the internet so please leave a voicemail otherwise I won't know you called....""2. If your internet does get locked up on the laptop AND the Blackberry, keep your phone on, take the battery out for 10 seconds and then put it all back together. The phone will automatically power back on and you'll see an hour glass turning for a while on your screen. If it lasts quite a while (more than 2 minutes) be patient and give it a little more time. It will come back to normal and you'll see the desktop with all your icons soon. I find this needs to happen almost daily if I'm using the tethering feature to my laptop. I'd say this is one of my only complaints because it's like you're rebooting now and then and I didn't expect that would happen when I bought this. The recovery isn't TOO bad though so I'm living with it.3. If you're trying to make a phone call while driving BE CAREFUL!!! I don't know about you but I don't have hardly any phone numbers memorized so you have to scroll and dig into the address book to get to your contact (if saved). Between small buttons on the keyboard in combination with having to give more attention to what you're scrolling through, it can be very dangerous. Make sure you're doing this as the car is stopped and even consider pulling over!!!4. In reviews I read before buying this Blackberry there were people who were disgruntled about AT&T wireless. I don't know if they've changed their entire customer service crew but I'm here to tell you that I've now had over the past few months some of THE best customer service about five times in a row. This customer service overshadowed just about any industry's customer service and it was all sought out straight from the AT&T customer service phone line. You can reach them by dialing 611 on your phone.5. I noticed the instruction pamphlet that comes with the phone is super simple for helping you explore things. If you have the time to explore throughout some of the folders on your desktop I think you'll find all kinds of applications that do seem logical in the folders they're in. But to get there, you do end up having to take some time that a lot of people just don't have. When I know something should have a feature on it I can't stop until I've found it. If you continue struggling to find what you're looking for you can call customer service or look into simple books like ""Blackberry for Dummies"". They might be able to expand on what the compact instruction pamphlet cannot.6. I'm kind of bummed the snooze alarm for the alarm (clock icon) has a max 10 minute time frame. I would have thought they'd allow you to customize that time and they don't. I'll live...7. If you've placed your SIM card from your previous phone into this Blackberry but you go to the address book (Rolodex icon) and you can't find your saved contacts, all you have to do is hit the blackberry button (just left of the roller ball) and it should have the option for ""SIM Phone Book"". You'll probably need to scroll down before you're going to find that on the pull down menu.8. There was some feedback online I read saying that AT&T limits the amount of data you can transfer back and forth through internet usage on your blackberry. I don't know about all internet plans but the key word you want to look for when choosing one is ""UNLIMITED DATA"" to avoid overage and expensive bills. The one I chose has unlimited data and tethering to my laptop for $60/mo. But, don't forget to add on an additional plan for your text messages! Texts are not included with the internet plan. The text plan I chose was only $5.00/mo.I truly feel spoiled with my new Blackberry Curve. Finally I feel like I've got quality, convenience and luxury all in the palm of my hand. That's been so nice. Mission accomplished.","5","helpful"

"BlackBerry Curve 8330 Smartphone, Silver (Verizon Wireless)┬á","BlackBerry","119.91","1","this phone had many problems.. on the transmission side , the microphone was not intelligable so that the person receiving the call could not understand the words...a constant off/on intermittant problem prevented use most of the time..phone will shut off and not respond to any button untill suddenly turning itself on....after hours or just few minutes... cleaning the contacts for the battery was no help..battery charged and was good... water drops were trapped inside the front cover. a verizon employee told me in person that it had internal water damage when i asked them to look at it...as i received it, i believe that the mic and the internal contacts of some subassemblies were corroded from water damage..after several weeks of attempting to get it to work, with help of two friends who own this same model phone, i threw it in the trash...","5","helpful"

"BlackBerry Q10 SQN100-2 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Black","BlackBerry","79.99","5","Went straight to the Verizon store soon as it came in to make sure it was legit and it was. I love it. I missed my old blackberry so much!! Takes some getting use to because it is slightly different from the curve/bold but if you are a BB fan then im sure this will do you just as good once you get use to it. It updated right away to 10.2 and I was able to get, at least, the amazon app store d/l with no problem. I will also be looking into side loading the google play store.The few bad review this phone has are from crazy diehard BB users who obviously hate change. I personally am a casual user. Facebook, email, picture, 9gag.. I miss a lot about my android but nothing is worth being without a physical keyboard!!!! It's honestly what ive always wanted a touch screen with a physical keyboard.. to me this is pretty close to perfection and it will be perfect if i can get google play store side loaded.Husband wants one as well so I will probably be ordering him one from the same seller.. :)Forgot to add, hands down, you can not find another phone that can beat the BB in battery life. Unplugged with 100% at 9am..it is now Quarter to 10pm.. and I am at 73% power. Plus 3 hour round trip today with the bluetooth music going from my phone to stereo, texting and fb browsing.. My HTC M7 wouldnt even make it two hours before i was down to 75% with less use.UPDATE:My husbands arrived today and we just got back from the verizon store. This phone is also legit and he loves it!.. no issues.","5","helpful"

"BlackBerry Storm 2 9550 Unlocked Phone - No Warranty","BlackBerry","79.99","5","You guys need to stop posting reviews of sellers on the product page. This is not where you post the sellers reviews. Your reviews will not warn people about the sellers. Please leave negative feedback on their sellers page in your orders menu. You can't rate the product bad if the seller did the order wrong or shipped you a crappy phone. Please keep those comments to the seller's feedback instead.Now back to the review. I always was fascinated about the blackberries. They were the first smartphones to out there that got the smartphone technology going. I wish Blackberry was able to continue this trend of touch screens since this phone was amazing and probably the biggest phone they made to date. I know RIM can do a better job of making a heck of a nice phone that could beat those android and apple users but RIM don't want to get out of the old school OS systems and their repetitive designs.Overall I sticked with this phone because of how well the email system is. This is very important to me for a computer engineer. This phone also does well for texting and that is all I need for a work phone. I use my Blackberry Bold 9930 for my usual texting and surfing.Overall this phone is probably the only phone you are going to see that has a huge screen and uses a blackberry operating system. I know the phone has its flaws but overall its a great phone if you get use to it. Also there are other ways to improve the phone too.Overall a great phone who needs email sent to their phones. It is the most simplest way to setup email and Blackberry made their phones to have the best email infrastructure before Apple blew them out of the water.I love this phone and will keep it for work until Apple puts RIM to the ground.","5","helpful"

"BlackBerry Torch 9810 White WiFi Unlocked GSM QuadBand 3G Cell Phone","BlackBerry","83.72","1","I bought this Blackberry thinking that it was 4G phone as it was advertised in the product description when I bought it and until about a week ago. The description used to say ""BLACKBERRY TORCH 9810 WHITE UNLOCKED GSM 4G WORLD PHONE WITH 3G BANDS 1,2,5&6, and now they changed it for ""BLACKBERRY TORCH 9810 WHITE WIFI UNLOCKED GSM QUADBAND 3G CELL PHONE"". I guess they changed because they realized their mistake... Still, they refuse to return my money back which I think is a FRAUD.After I got the phone and used it for less than 2 weeks, I noticed that it was even slower than my former 3G BB so I took it to my phone provider to check what was going on and they told me that the problem was that my new Blackberry was 3G not 4G as advertised. When I wrote to the seller saying that this wasn't the product I was expecting and I wanted to return it, they say:""Depending on which carrier you are using it with will determine what speed you can get and if 4g is available but I have gone ahead and authorized your return request so you can send it back to us""I was happy that at least I will get my money back. But a couple of weeks after I returned the item, they wrote me an email saying that they will only refund $169.84 for the Blackberry I returned, even though I paid $287.99!!!!! This means they are taking $118.15 from me! And they don't recognize that it was their responsibility to have advertised the product mistakenly.I have called the seller 6 times and talked to different people from the Department of Returns and Costumer Services, and they always find that ""I'm right"", but ""they don't have the 'authority' to give my money back"". The last time I called, the agent run out of arguments and told me he will transfer me to his supervisor, which it turned out to be a voice mail... unacceptable!! They always say that the person in charge will call me back and he never did.This whole process has been absolutely annoying and time-consuming, I felt absolutely cheated and nobody in the company was willing to take responsibility of their mistake (MISLEADING ADVERTISEMENT and then MY MONEY STOLEN). I would never ever will buy from this seller again. After all... I guess it is time to change to an Apple device, where they do care for the costumer satisfaction.I will also fill out a consumer complaint with the Directory of State and Local Consumer Agencies and will see what happens... I really hope that the seller will call me back, recognize their error and return the rest of my money.","5","helpful"

I was able to get minecraft running with only 512mb's of RAM!3. LED is quite useful! I wish it had more uses but its pretty good!4. Very stock android. Which is a must have5. Dual Sims!6. An SD card slot! Which makes me very happy.7. Great battery!! Its insane! Its better then my iPhone 5 battery!8. Its rootable! I tested it with KingRoot and it works just fine! Which is a great advantage!And here are the cons:Cons:1. The touchscreen is crap. I was able to run games, but the touchscreen is so bad that the latency makes the games unplayable almost. Strangely, you don't see this on the OS.2. The camera. Its garbage. I could care less since I don't take pictures, but for those who do, its crap.3. Not enough ram! The processor is fine, but with 512mb's of ram, backgrounding apps is nearly impossible.4. It doesn't support lolipop. I don't understand why, because if it did it would be so much faster, and it would have more value.So there you have it. Its not perfect.

"BLU Dash JR W D141w Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Android Cell Phone - White","BLU","34.99","1","I needed an unlocked sim card phone for a trip to Costa Rica. I read the reviews both positive and negative and decided for short term to just text, call and email this phone would be OK. It wasn't OK. Not even close to OK. In addition to all the other negatives from other reviews I will add that the antenna on this phone is REALLY REALLY weak. I never could make a phone call because at best I had 1 bar and the call didn't go through. I never managed to get a text through but I did get the email to work. Unfortunately, I could only send emails if I was sitting within 5 feet of the router. Oh yeah, there is the battery life. There isn't any. OK, I'm exaggerating. If you don't use it, it has a day or two. If you forget to turn off Wi Fi you've got a couple hours.","5","helpful"

I am not sure what I should have expected knowing the purchase price for a cell phone was so low, but I would have been able to overlook the extremely slow performance, lack of available storage and horrible camera quality if I could have gotten the phone to power on reliably. It would go to sleep, then we would have to hold in the power button to turn it back on sometime as many as 10 times to ""maybe"" get the phone to turn back on.Amazon was fantastic and took the thing back immediately which is a testament to their incredible service.I now understand that the ""DASH"" portion of the name describes the thoughtless manner in which they assemble these phones.","5","helpful"

If you buy a Blue product don't count on their support.This is a good low to mid smartphone and has every feature that I would use. The battery life is crazy.

"BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- Global GSM Unlocked - Grey","BLU","139","4","I like this phone better than the BLU 5.0C Studio HD I had before. I've had the Energy X Plus for a couple weeks now and everything is working perfectly. Battery life is WAY better than any other cell I've owned..ever! My only possible gripe is I would have liked a bigger memory, however this phone IS available with a larger memory..but at a much higher price, and I had a budget to fit this one into, so more money for 16G or 32G memory wasn't going to happen. Video playback and sound are pretty good, and the 5.5"" screen has excellent resolution and color. Op system is Lollipop 5.0, not the 5.1 that is quoted here and there. I use a Net10/Tracfone micro SIM and it uses the ATT system, which is excellent around here (CT-USA). SIM and SDcards install in little drawers that come out of the side of the phone. Easy to install. I also bought a light green protection case for the phone that has a built in kickstand, also available from Amazon. I think it ran maybe $10 and is worthwhile if you think the phone will get dropped once in a while. I've dropped mine twice onto concrete and absolutely zero damage.","5","helpful"

"Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black)","Huawei","229.99","1","*** Update: After using it over 1 year and well past the warranty, I find it the worst purchase I have made in last 10 years. The screen had a burnout on top right corner just 3 weeks before the warranty expired. The rude customer representative said they cannot do anything about it. Then after I used strong language, the weasel changed his tune and said that I can ship it to them and they will look at it but won't promise to fix it. I asked for a Loaner phone during the time this junk is fixed, and they don't offer one.Not to mention that they never offered an over the air update to Android 5.0 (and now 6.0). ***I bought the Mate 2 since the Sony Xperia T2-Ultra I had purchased earlier was a lemon, and while my iPhone 3G was still functioning well, the battery had begun to drain twice as fast and iOS updates had ceased in 2010.After exhaustive research, I ended up buying Huawei, and so far my experience has been mixed.Hardware: If there is one thing Huawei engineers did well, it was the design. Industry leading battery (from Sony) life, among world's top-10 in screen-to-body-ratio, and elegant cream color frame. Although the screen resolution is only 720p, the images and fonts appear bright and clear, and it is hard to discern whether full-HD (1080p) would be any better.The Sony camera module produces sharp and clear pics, and you can shoot a 1080p HD video for 45 min, 720p video for 1h 45m, and VGA video for 2h 45m. Overall, about 40% components are from Japan, the corning Gorilla Glass from Kentucky, US, and the rest from Greater China. The back cover is easy to unlock and installing the SIM card and MicroSD was a breeze.Software: Very poorly designed Android 4.3 and Huawei UI. The icons are separated by huge gaps so that a single row fits only 5. Space optimization is not Android's strongest suite. The available email client is poorly designed, and the status bar at the top, as well as the navigation bar at the bottom are fixed, so you are forced to view things absent a full screen.Bloatware: I can tolerate this substandard software, but what really makes me angry despite the great hardware, is the bloatware. Huawei specifically trumpets on its website, ""no BLOATWARE."" Yet, this phone is loaded with it. Asphalt-8, Navigate-66, Bitcasa, Weather-Channel, DLNA, ""Browser"", facebook, Twitter, and more than a dozen google apps including the revolting Google ""play Games"", ""Play Newsstand"", ""Play Movies"" and what have you.I wanted to return this phone, but after disastrous experience with Sony, I thought I would hold out until the Android 5.0 update to see if I can uninstall all this junk. I should have waited for the Alcatel One Touch Hero 2+ which is going to come out next month, installed with cyanogen OS, that is infinitely more flexible and customizable compared to this nonsense I am saddled with now.Huawei, are you listening?","5","helpful"

"Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black)","Huawei","229.99","5","I have been using this phone for 2 weeks now. The quick review is that it is a great buy for the price.I was waiting around for an invite to get the Oneplus One but bought this instead. Yesterday, I got an invite for the One and was thinking to buy it for my wife but am buying a second Ascent Mate2 instead. I got a bit freaked about the yellow screen issue with the One and I guess that stupid forum and the Oneplus company tactics kind of wore me down too much. Anyways, this phone covers all my needs and more at a very fair price and that makes me a happy customer! So I just ordered a second one for my wife.I would also recommend the Trident Case Cyclops for it.","5","helpful"
"Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black)","Huawei","229.99","4","I love this phone.1. The battery life is insane; I went 48 hours without rechargng and it still had 30% left.2. Unlocking was a cinch. Just put the s/n and imei on a webform and they'll give you the boot unlock code instantly.3. I was then able to install twrp and the carbon version of cyanogenmod and had, for the first time in my life, a fully unlocked, rooted, bloatware-free phone.I then got a data only sim from at&t, ported my number to google and have data, text, and voice for $25 per month, vs the $90 I had been paying to Verizon, so the phone will very soon pay for itself.The only con is, it's very big. It often won't fit in my pocket.","5","helpful"
"Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black)","Huawei","229.99","3","I loved this phone...for the brief time that I had it in my possession. Can't beat the price for what you get, the speed was great and the screen was very beautiful. Sadly, one week into ownership I was hit with the dreaded ""permanent restart"" bug that I've heard of other phone owners experiencing. It made the phone restart one time after another until the battery was dead. I hoped that that might reset it, but when I plugged it back in there was no fix. I had to return it and now I have a Moto G LTE, which works great. No bugs. I was using the T-Mobile LTE network in the Memphis, TN area and I always got reliable, fast downloads.This is a great phone if you want to be aware of the bugs you might experience. I will allow that I may have gotten the one faulty unit our of a production volume of several thousand, but it put a bad taste in my mouth, which is why I went with the Moto G LTE.","5","helpful"
"Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black)","Huawei","229.99","5","I made this original review in Spanish, but Amazon won't accepted, Spanish is my native language. I Would give it the highest rating accepted only, if the memory can extended more than 32 MB. And if I had pen as Samsung note. But for the price I paid $ 250 I created this rating is the fairest. Price productIt is a Chinese phone, nowadays, almost everything you see here in the US comes from China, and I won't say that this is bad or good. It is part of the economy. Quality has no borders or owner, I like to use and have the best technology for over 20 years, I am an engineer in electronics and communications have worked for over 20 years in Mexico and for over 10 here. I am a fan of technology, for many years Samsung fan, but prices have skyrocketed as Apple, so I had to start investigating other alternatives on the market.That is what I sought to find a phone without a contract that could be used with T-Mobile, with 4 GLTE, the battery life for me should be used all day even using it all day (this phone takes me 2.5 days) that use Android as a system operation, which has English as a secondary or primary, the cost is not greater than $ 250, which will be positioned to expand memory up to 32 MB main, your display is greater than 6 inches, which have higher front camera 5 M pixels and more than 15 M pixels in the back.Very pleasant surprise to find my next phone with all that or more in the Huawei Mate 2. Best phone I've used in 20 years, I'm so glad I share and to recommend and make this review after a month of use. I will renew without regrets, the 4 other phones in my family.","5","helpful"
"Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black)","Huawei","229.99","3","I started out with a Palm Treo 300 for Sprint in 2002, so I was one of the early smartphone users- back in the day when they offered $10 unlimited data to entice you into buying a $399 device. ( in 2002, unlimited meant you used 50-100mb a month, tops)My impression of the HAM2 is it's a solid phone, call quality was OK and pictures looked fine The screen looked as good as the iPhone indoors, just a lot bigger.. . Battery life is probably the strongest asset for this device and if I was a road warrior ( I'm retired), having 2 days of usage would be great. I wear two phones on my hip and this one pushed my iPhone 4s to the #2 spot. I plugged my T-mobile sim into this new phone and put my Airvoice sim into my unlocked iPhone. Compared to my iPhone the screen was too dark for my tastes outside in the daylight. I'm outside a lot in Florida.I missed my physical home button and the software seemed kinda off the mark. No doubt the Chinese are still learning what Americans like. I decided against fiddling with Play store apps in order to try increasing it's functionality- I wanted to use it as is. Size turned out to be more trouble than a plus. I never worried about damaging my iPhone, but I always had to mentally protect this larger phone. It felt too large for my pocket - so it has to be in belt case and that got in the way of my seat belt. My 45 minute daily chats with my retired buddy didn't feel comfortable. I tried using a bluetooth earpiece, but the call volume was too low compared to my iPhone. Answering regular calls took a couple seconds longer than my smaller iPhone, due to the larger case and size. . After a week, I moved my sim back to my iPhone 4s in order to see, if I missed the larger Huawei Ascend Mate 2. I did not miss it in any way shape or form, so I returned the HAM2. . I hope to see more new unlocked smartphones in the $200-$300 price range that have all the GSM/LTE radio bands- I really like that trend.","5","helpful"

With wifi off and light usage, battery lasts more than one week. Phone is solid, well constructed and has survived some nasty falls with no problems.

Not as crisp as Note 3 (OLED), but perfectly fine.Performance is snappyCamera is nice (though Samsung Note 3 has nice options for both video and camera)Well-built and reasonably lightweight for its sizeFits nicely in hand (unless you have small hands)Running Lollipop (no upgrade to Marshmallow in the near future)Very reasonably priced for unlocked phablet of this quality.CONS:Phone quality is ok, but you have to position your ear a little more accurate than my old Note 3. Also, volume is not as strongOnly runs HSPDA+ for AT&T instead of LTE (in America). I doubt most people could tell the difference unless you really need that throughput.Power button takes a little more effort to push (actually may be an advantage to avoid turning on/off the phone too easy)Documentation is minimal, but sufficient.Overall, great phone worth the $350 I paid for it.

It arrived in almost mint condition, came with everything listed. Wall charger, usb plug, and manual booklet. However there are some things I had to get used to a bit and one of them being the power button in the back of the phone. It took a bit of getting used to since all Samsung phones that I've purchased have had the power button on the side. Also on the LG g2 you have the option of tapping the middle of the phone to turn it on or you can use the power button in the back, and sometimes I would keep it in my pocket and it would turn on and butt dial someone by accident so I turned that feature off. The phone is also super sensitive to touch. However the phone itself is just phenomenal. The battery last 2 days without charging it. The camera quality is Crystal clear. Front facing camera is a bit smeared, but it does the job. Overall I give it 5 stars!","5","helpful"

"LG G3 Beat LG-D722 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android 4.4 Smartphone - Black","LG","198.97","1","I'm a long-time LG fan (all my favorite phones have been LGs). I opted for the G3 because I wanted to stick with LG, but didn't want to shell out the $800 for the newly released G4. By all accounts,the phones were very similar, with minimal upgrades to the G4 in areas that didn't particularly matter to me. Sadly, the G3 is dreadful. My 3-year-old LG Optimus G was quicker and more responsive at the end of its life than this was right out of the box. Some low lights include:- The battery life is poor - I rarely get more than 12 hours without having to charge- The touch screen is unresponsive - I frequently have to touch several times for it to register and even unlocking the screen is a pain- It is slow, slow, slow - loading anything takes forever and often when I go to close open apps/programs, the screen doesn't show that I have any running (WTH is that?)- Forget about multitasking - if an app is updating you can't use another app; it'll just shut down in the middle of whatever you're doingReally,the only positive I have on this phone is the design, which is aesthetically pleasing. Not enough, however, for me to keep it. I guess it's time for me to head over to the competition.","5","helpful"

Woke up to a distinct burning plastic smell and an ridiculously hot phone that left a visible mark on my nightstand. The heat melted the plastic on the back of the device, melted the inner plug of the official USB-C charger, and melted the charging port of the phone itself. With the USB port fried, the notifications in the last two screenshots show up constantly.I can let this go as a fluke since I had several months of a working unit, as long as I get a working replacement. Called Google and answered their questions, which in turn put me on a 3-way call with LG customer support. Answered all their questions, gave the IMEI number on the phone, everything checked out for a replacement upon me sending them a copy of the purchase receipt. Simply made a PDF of this item's Amazon purchase invoice and received a call from an LG rep in the Philippines the next day saying they cannot honor the warranty since ""this phone was bought unlocked."" I proceeded to explain to them ALL Nexus devices are unlocked, even if you purchase them from the carrier. She just kept repeating the same line over & over & over again that they cannot honor warranties on unlocked Nexus phones.This definitely sours my entire experience with the Google brand, and especially with LG. It also tells me to NEVER buy a phone from Amazon, even if it says ""(U.S. Warranty)"" in the title.BUYER BEWARE.","5","helpful"

Widgets are nice and add some flair to the menu, widgets are handled on the Renoir much better than on samsung touch whiz phones.-Web browsing is good for a non smartphone, probably the best I've used. also Wifi is a great addition.-I never used the music or video playback, but divx support is a hugge plus, the radio was clear and functional.Hardware-the phones looks much better in person, the three buttons on the buttons look tacky in pictures but are very nice in person, it's no iphone, but it is a good looking phone. The back is very nice and it feels sturdy, but still plastic-The touch screen is resistive, which is a bad thing. Texting with the full soft qwerty took some getting used it and is leagues behind the iphone. Drawing using the picture editor was a nightmare, even with a stylus. Tapping numbers was good enough, as was basic menu navigation.CameraArguably the main feature of the Renoir is the 8 megapixel camera. It is an excellent camera...for a phone. Taking excellently colored shots with a good XENON(!!) flash, and plenty of in phone editing options, like filters. It is much better than the LG viewty and the Samsung ultra touch camera and comparable to the cheapest point and shoots. That said compared with a ~$200 canon point and shoot, the Renoir gets blown out of the water. But if all you use your camera for are posed shots in outdoor lighting, this could be an acceptable replacement for a point and shoot. This is probably the best camera availabe in any phone, at least in the top 3.Go to flickr, search LG Renoir for some good sample shots.It also takes decent video, I didn't use it often though.In conclusion, I do recommend this phone for anyone looking a fun, good looking, touch screen feature phone with a great camera. I think the black version is better looking, so I would get that.","5","helpful"
"LG KF900 Prada II Unlocked Phone with Camera with Flash, Full Touch Screen, Slide-Out QWERTY Keypad, MS Office, PDF, Text Reading--International Version with No Warranty (Black)","LG Electronics MobileComm USA","100","3","I bought the original LG Prada (KE850) as a birthday gift my wife last year. It was a very fashionable and stylish looking phone, which my wife (in her early 30s) loves, but the reception and the missing 850Mhz band left something to be desired on the AT&T wireless network, which is reasonable as this phone was never intended for the US market. It would probably work better on T-Mobile US network (since they don't use 850 band). We ended up returning it because of that. Mind you, the software on this phone is very simple and basic, which is perfect for my wife since she hardly text and rarely used anything else.I was excited when the Prada II is announced and it comes with quad-band this time (however, 3G would only work outside of US)! However, I was disappointed as soon as I found out they decided to add a slide-out QWERTY keyboard. Seeing in person (at CES) how much thicker the new phone turned me off. It has gained 40% in thickness (16.8mm versus the older but slimmer 12mm Prada I) and slightly taller than the old phone (quarter inch). The ""Ooze"" factor of the original Prada phone is gone. This new phone would be a good choice for these who texts often but doesn't want another me-too looking phones. However, for my wife, the weight-gain is a deal-breaker.UPDATE: I did ended up buying this phone for my wife to use on AT&T wireless, as she doesn't have data plan and don't want to pay an extra $30/month, the iPhone doesn't make sense. This works well for her since she only calls and texts, but due to reception and call dropping issues (which might just be AT&T), we are shopping for a new replacement phone.","5","helpful"
"LG KP500 Cookie Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Digital Media Player--International Version (Black), No-Warranty","LG Electronics MobileComm USA","79","5","I only buy unlocked cell phones and simply drop in my prepaid SIM card. The Speaker in my Motorola L7 was going bad and I had to use the speakerphone setting just to hear the phone normally. So I was looking for a slightly better, more sophisticated phone. A semi-smart phone. This Cookie fit the bill perfectly. Its only slightly larger than the Motorola L7 and actually fits in the L7's case. I was apprehensive about buying this phone because it received a few really bad reviews. I took a chance and I'm GLAD I did. The only complaint I have is, in order to answer the phone several separate finger strokes are required. The instructions could be better but are for the most part adequate. The phone is fairly easy to navigate and intuitive. The camera isn't to bad (I haven't used the video yet). My only big complaint is if you store your phone book info in the phone as well as the SIM Card the phone book info is listed twice on the phones display. I would like to have WI-FI but I knew this feature was missing. I don't have a data plan so I can't say how well it surf's the web or how easy or difficult it is to read your eMail. I paid $133.00 for this phone and one week later it went on sale AGAIN for $99.00. Im very pleased with this phone even though I paid $34.00 more than I could have if I had procrastinated. You can listen to your music using the built in speaker, however if you use the radio feature you'll need to use the supplied earbuds because the antenna is in the earbud wire. Its a nonstandard plug, BTW. I now need reading glasses and you can magnify your ""Phonebook"" which is convenient but sadly none of the other displays can be enlarged. I've taken pictures of my family and friends and assigned their photos to their phone numbers ( the instruction book is weak on describing this feature) so when they call their picture pops up on the display. I would definitely buy this phone again.","5","helpful"
"LG KP500 Cookie Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Digital Media Player--International Version (Black), No-Warranty","LG Electronics MobileComm USA","79","4","I was devastated when my beloved pink Samsung Star smart phone died after less than a year of use. The screen wouldn't respond anymore and getting it fixed would cost about $60-100, the price of a new phone, so I took the leap and bought the Cookie instead.As someone who has used a touch screen phone for a while, I'm not too impressed by the features of the LG Cookie. If this is your first smart phone, you won't notice the shortcomings. This product does give you quite a bang for your buck. Its best feature is probably its camera and photo editing functions. For those of you who like taking pictures with your cell phone, the image touch-up tools are very advanced and plentiful.However, I use this phone mostly for texting, calling, and organizing daily events--areas in which it has been a let-down. I loved the texting feature on my Samsung Star that automatically shifted the keyboard so that it would be horizontal (like that of a computer/laptop), but the Cookie's motion sensor is very poor and it usually takes me a few tries to get the sideways keyboard to pop up. According to my boyfriend, the call volume from my end is very poor (a big problem because we're hundreds of miles apart). Lastly, the calendar widget is very similar to that of the Star, but it has way too many fields that require input before you can finish entering a simple event.Those of you who like widgets will be a little disappointed as the Cookie has a minimal attitude towards displaying superfluous applications. The games that came with the phone were visually appealing. There is a good array of ringtones to choose from, but the wallpaper/theme selection is sparse. I really like the video camera function, which I don't recall being present in my old Samsung.","5","helpful"
"LG Lancet - VW820 - 8GB Windows Smartphone - Verizon - Black ...","LG","39.95","5","It's sad that the best phone on the market gets the fewest sales. iPhones are cool but they don't provide everything a Droid or Windows phone provides. Why is the Win phone better than Droid? No bloatware.

And this goes for many apps.The music store uses Xbox so it is robust and high quality. Plus, I pair the phone with my PC and I can sync all the iPhone music my wife bought.

I bought it as a spare for when my kids are having their phones repaired. Texting is difficult when you have meathooks for hands but my son actually got used to it quickly.

Just putting your finger near the fingerprint scanner was ridiculously hot to the touch after playing music for 30-45 minutes. In fact, I believe the screen cracked from the overheating within the first 2 months so I immediately called LG to deal with the issue. However, I was about to leave the country for a work trip (6 weeks abroad) so when I called I was told they couldn't ship abroad, thus I decided to wait until I got back to the states.While abroad, I realized that the overheating had screwed up the camera. Regardless of whether I opened the camera on the official app or through a 3rd party app, I would get a pop-up report that said it couldn't access the camera. This waws particularly an issue if it was above 75 degrees ambient temperature; the hotter the weather the less likely that the camera would work- due to it overheating even more quickly. Multiple times, just trying to open the camera app caused the phone to spontaneously restart. About 3 weeks into my trip abroad, my phone's camera stopped working completely. I tried all of the google support team's suggestions and nothing worked.Avoid purchasing this phone unless you want some serious headaches.","5","helpful"

"LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone with 5.2-Inch 32GB H790 4G LTE (Carbon Black)","LG","399","5","Bought as a replacement to a iPhone4 and bring the wife out of the Borg mindless collective. She is extremely pleased by it. Easy to use (no branded overlay OS-thankfully). It has worked flawlessly since purchased a few months ago.Unlocked, like all cell phones should be. It is used on the Google Fi network (look it up, we pay less than $30/month for 2GB data and phone service and no contract BS). Works internationally.I am usually a harsh critic on technology, but have nothing but good things to say on this. Makes my life much easier when there is a phone question (ie, I despise Apple products and their arbitrary proprietary encryption/fining system and idiotic way of pulling things from the phone if you do not want to upload your life to the ""cloud"".)Only issue was the Hangouts app took over the text message program.

"LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone with 5.2-Inch 32GB H790 4G LTE (Carbon Black)","LG","399","1","Bought the Honor 5X thinking it may be awesome for $199. While it was decent, the UI was just too slow to handle. The EMUI was neat in many ways but the lags and stutters after a few days became really annoying. Returned it and bought the Nexus 5X since it was on sale for $349. Wow!Have not owned a Nexus since the Nexus 5. My how I missed it. Loaded all my apps and got everything arranged that I wanted. No lag anywhere, fast as pie and things just friggin' work. Android 6.0.1 works wonderfully and T-Mobile WiFi Calling and VoLTE worked straight out of the box. Wonderful.Owned the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4 (loved that phone) and the Nexus 5 - glad to be back. This is a great handset and it's so nice to be away from phablets for a while (iPhone 6s Plus as nice, but ohh so big). Considered the Nexus 6P too - but the added cost and the size made me sway towards the 5X. No complaints! Love this thing.UPDATE 2-27-16: Wow. What a few weeks difference makes. This phone has slowed down, it constantly lags, battery life has gotten worse (even after deleting the notorious Facebook battery-hogging app). I have researched quite a bit and even after deleting the cache partition in recovery mode, deleting the disk cache every day, doing a restore without a previous backup - this thing will just crawl doing several things like listening to Pandora, trying to take a picture (OMG it lags here) and in other areas). Never seen a phone lag and stutter and crash this bad, and this is a phone with a SnapDragon 808 and vanilla Android! I am perplexed and after reading quit a few forum posts at Android Central, this seems very common. Unreal. Well, sent an exchange at Amazon for the Nexus 6P yesterday and going to try that unit, even though the size concerns me a bit. We'll see. I've had several Nexus phones (Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4 and Nexus 5) and have never seen performance be a problem like this. Sigh - Google must have really blown in on the Nexus 5X.","5","helpful"

I am very pleased with the delivery. It was really fast.Packed in good manner. Battery was 70% charged, started without any problem. This is unlocked model and I used AT&T SIM to it. It worked without any problem.It is only 1 day since I am using it so it is too early to give any comments. So far it is very good. I haven't faced any problems with it.Very light weight compared to existing windows phone 7 HTC HD7.Call voice quality is not that good but with this cost it is acceptable.UPDATE: AT&T Data plan is not working with this phone. I spoke to AT&T customer service and even if they registered this Phone's IMEI number in the account, Data Communication is still not working. I guess I just wasted the money on this 'Cananda' based phone. Once I used Nokia E72 unlocked phone with AT&T, and it worked like charm. I wish I could have the same Nokia phone handy.UPDATE 8/22/2013: After reviewing an user comment, I realized that I gave wrong feedback. Changing 4 star to 2 Star.

"LG Optimus G E970 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Black","LG","449","4","This is my first smart phone and my first experience with Android, although I have long experience with Linux systems. This is a very good, mostly-unlocked phone. As other people wrote, it is similar to LG Nexus 4 (but $100 cheaper and has 4G) but less powerful than LG Nexus 5 (which is similar to G2 but is twice more expensive than E970). I considered many smart phones, but the ones in my price range were this and Motorola Moto G. E970 was $20 more expensive but far more powerful than Moto G. My voice/data plan is a non-ATT discount company that uses the ATT network. After I installed the SIM card, it took a while for the tech support to activate it and even more to connect it to the 4G/LTE data network. They had to text me two patches to install to make it work (it was very easy: each text message had an Install button). Now it works flawlessly but I haven't done any speed test yet. Overall, the phone has an extremely fast CPU (4-core 1.5Ghz), sufficient RAM (2GB), plenty of SD space (32GB with the bonus SD card), excellent WiFi, good camera (8Mpixels), excellent bright display, and excellent battery.Now the bad news: it's intended mostly for an ATT plan. Of course the phone hardware can work with any provider; it's the preinstalled Android that has locked some apps and services. To be more specific, first, it comes preloaded with many ATT apps. This is fine since you can stop them and disable them from Settings/General/Application. But there is one that you cannot disable: My AT&T. When you do Call/My Contacts to call a person from your contacts, it tries to connect to your ATT account to synchronize your contacts. At that point, you need to push Back to stop it and go to your contact list. It's not very important but annoying since you always have to push Back every time you make a call or text. I tried to fix this by deselecting ""Auto-sync data"" in Settings/General/Accounts&sync but many times (always when I restart the phone), I get the same problem. The only solution to this is to ""root"" your phone and uninstall the ATT apps. But the most annoying thing is that ATT (as well as most US mobile providers) has locked tethering by software. Tethering is used when there is no WiFi and you want to connect other devices to your data network through your phone. It is illegal in other countries for a data provider to lock tethering, but here in US, they can do this by soft-locking your phone and sell you a special data plan to unlock it. This is very greedy: it's like your home internet provider charge you extra if you connect a router at home to connect other PCs. So in US, you need to call your provider to unlock tethering, and they will text you a special patch specific to your SIM card.How to root your phone: Rooting means that you get a complete control of your phone, similar to the root account in Linux or Administrator account in Windows. Is it legal? of course it is. It's like asking: is it legal to work on Windows using an Administrator account? It's your phone and you payed a full price. If your phone manufacture voids the warranty because of that, you should report it to forums so that nobody buys its phones. Also you can always unroot. Note though, as root you may do destructive things to your phone and even ""brick"" it, which is extremely difficult to restore (unlike Windows). Also, you may do things that void your data plan (such as unlocking tethering); so read your plan contract carefully. How to root: read the first guide in forum.xda-developers DOT com/optimus-g-att. How to uninstall locked apps: use the app ""ES File Explorer File Manager"" with Root Explorer ON.How to unlock tethering: DON'T. If you are in US, ask your mobile provider. If you are outside US and you are sure your provider allows it, then root your phone and unlock tethering (search: ""e970 tether sqlite"").","5","helpful"

"LG P970 Optimus Unlocked Android Smartphone with 5MP Camera, Wi-Fi, 4-inch Touch screen - No Warranty - Black","LG","120","4","After quite a bit of comparison shopping I thought I found a great starter smartphone. I love the screen clarity and the rest of the reviews on the internet convinced me to choose this phone. I was looking forward to using this phone for years to come. I got it today and to get started I called a local Global Wireless network provider who uses the Verizon cell towers. They informed me that just because this phone's network spec supported GSM did not automatically guarantee the Verizon Wireless Network allows this phone in their service. They had never heard of this phone. I also called Verizon and sure enough, it is not among ""their list of tested and approved"" phones. Turns out I also was not fully comprehending what unlocked phone meant. I thought I could use my new LG P970 Optimus unlocked phone with any wireless network of my choice provided the technical details were within the network providers parameters. I'm still not clear what unlocked means. Now I'll be paying a restocking fee to return it, and sadly I would rather not return it, but A T & T is a more expensive network provider. It takes time to compare shop for a good phone if you don't want to be forced to buy from your local wireless provider. I also found after receiving the phone, in order to save photos taken from the two cameras you have to have an external memory card. So you may as well buy either the 16GB or the 32GB flash memory card at the same time you buy the phone to fully utilize it's capabilities.","5","helpful"

"Life One X Quad Band Unlocked - 16GB (White)","BLU","330","5","If you're more of visual person than I have a review for the phone here that was done some time ago: http://youtu.be/MjOV1voG5c4You can also find the unboxing here: http://youtu.be/K4BOK46ziOkThis phone is the definition of price to performance for me. 5.0in IPS display, 1.5Ghz Quad Core, and 2GB of RAM with 16GB internal storage (which is 12GB useable space) which is plenty for all my media and apps. Due note you have 1GB of dedicated storage for your apps on top of that. All this for a little less than $300 is great.Now with that being said, being stuck on JellyBean is not great but its easily overlooked when you pick up the phone and notice little to no lag in daily use which includes my social networks, checking several email accounts hourly, heavy gaming, and texting. I use my phone A LOT at work cause we have a lot of down time right now.I'm a very heavy user and have been for years so I pretty much murder my phone battery with ease. However with this not so much. I can get about 10-12hrs out of it easily especially if I have Wifi off with little gaming. The Wifi drains a lot more than I would like but the same can be said for other phones as well. By the way this has a 2000mAh battery and its pretty good. With a ton of gaming and youtube, I get to %15 in about 7hrs.The screen being IPS is great even at odd angles. There is very little light bleed as some have complained about. Coming from a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, my eyes are very appreciative of the bigger display and finally being able to play my YouTube videos in full HD is a joy. The colors are decent (not the best) and the sound is nice and loud.Speaking of HD YouTube, I've had no problem since the day I got the phone playing my YouTube videos in HD. The phone gets great signal for me down here in Houston, TX and my speeds are 15Mbps down and 2Mbps up. Plenty for my needs and it really makes LTE pretty irrelevant for me since I don't stream Netflix or anything.The LED notification light is pretty much green when any notification comes in and red when its charging. That's it. I've tried changing it with apps but none have worked for me so I don't think it can be changed at this time. I'm pretty sure that's a fault of Android 4.2. Let's talk about that quickly as well.Back on May 1st, BLU had promised Kit Kat for a big range of its devices including the Life Series which would be this phone and Blu's current flagship series, the Life Pure lineup. The date came and went and all anyone got was the FaceBook update stating ""They haven't forgotten about Kit Kat"" and that they would now release it in June. Well, that's about a week away as of this review so we'll see if that holds true or not but is a major concern that it's taken this long in the 1st place. They've been loading JellyBean onto their devices for a long time despite other manufactures always trying to keep the latest on their devices even though some are just as slow to update depending on how well the device sells. I surely hope they keep their word this time. However, as I said before, its not a big factor to me due to the hardware in the phone really keeping it snappy and Kit Kat will only make it faster when it comes out.In conclusion, the Life One X is a perfect price to performance for anyone coming from a low-end to mid-end range phone and it's very nice to see such great performance and specs at this price point. If you can't afford the the latest and greatest from your respective carriers (besides Verizon) which will set you back at least $500-$700 than you're no longer stuck with slow crap phones. Blu along with other manufactures whose products can be found right here on Amazon are worth a look or two. The Life One X is worth every penny and I'm very happy with it.Update 07/02/14Phone still works great but I have some gripes with Blu. As of now, there still has been no Kit Kat update for this particular device and others Blu has put out. A few days ago, Blu did announce that it was rolling out KK for its latest devices (Vivo IV and Life Pure XL) along with some of its hottest selling devices which I guess Life one X was not among them cause it didn't make the list at all. I've only been waiting a month but others have been waiting since the beginning of the year for Kit Kat and still will not have it. Blu has also missed 2 promised deadlines for this update as well. I like the phones but the company really needs to rethink how they treat their customers. The greatest spec phones in the world will feel tired and old quickly when running outdated software. Especially when said software is over a year old (Jellybean 4.2.1 was released November 27, 2012 and is currently the software on the Life One X and most Blu phones).","5","helpful"

Shortly after that, maybe a month or so later, it completely crashed. First it started turning on and off by itself repeatedly then it would freeze (for several hours) in the start-up screen sometimes making the sound like a cd skipping, then it would die and you'd plug it back in and it would randomly start up either glitching out and stopping and shutting down again or start up all the way (maybe twice) for very short periods of time before shutting down again. Over all a good price if you want a temporary (very short term) replacement and back up your phone regularly but not worth it in the long run. Wish I hadn't wasted my money on this phone.

So the phone comes like is should, with the charger, USB cable, 2500 removable battery and the phone itself, a AT&T sim and a printed paper with the instructions for make the phone fully unlocked as well.Which totally worked for me on the first try (remember that after 10 failed attempts the phone is no longer able to be unlocked, so do it carefully). I am not going to make a review about the software, because I am part of the Windows 10 Insider program and already upgraded this phone to W10 Mobile. So I am not going to make software reviews on a beta OS just yet but for me battery life is good so far.The phone fells good in the hand, the screen is really good for the density of pixels it has and the performance so far with games is decent. The main camera is average but still better than older Lumias like 820 and 535. The front facing camera is ok but if you want to upload selfies to Instagram will look washed out until you get a really good light to compensate the noise and lack of resolution.What I really love is that, with this same hardware, an Android phone is lagging so bad and Windows Mobile (beta) and Windows Phone 8.1 are rocking better.For the rest as a power user you can't beat this price. For the people asking in Latin American countries for this phone, I repeat, the Lumia 640 RM-1073 that sells CrazyLowPricesForYou you can use this phone with your local carrier (just check the frecuency bands are compatible with your carrier). I test it with Movistar and Kolbi in Costa Rica. This phone cost me 56 mil colones ($120) going through taxes and shipping here. My parents and some friends want some of this phones so I am going to order more but if you look for a better camera and better battery life look for the Lumia 640 XL.

I tried Google Maps just to make sure it wasn't Go having issues. Maps kept losing GPS signal. Pokemon Go has my avatar jumping around the map or stopping then sprinting to a new location. It also shows me on the sidewalk instead of road driving, or inside someone's backyard instead of sidewalk. Other times my avatar simply doesn't move at all.Everything else is awesome about the phone but this GPS thing is a bummer. Going to play with the phone a couple more days then send it back to Amazon if nothing improves.I will update my review if things go back to normal like it was for the first 40 hrs of use.UPDATE: 10/25I sent in my first phone and exchanged it for a new one.... same situation. It worked fine for a day then the GPS started going haywire. Sometimes it connects right away and stays connected... Most of the time it takes forever to find a signal and it loses it fast. This makes navigation unreliable at best and dangerous at worst. On the bright side, because of this GPS problem, Pokemon Go runs around the screen and I am collecting buddy candy a lot faster and without my butt having to leave my comfortable couch. Sometimes the app asks me if I am a passenger in a car, but usually, it just gives me credit for walking. I can play Splatoon and still get Pokemon Go candy and eggs to hatch! Can't use the phone for reliable Pokestop collecting but boy can I 'walk' like crazy with this phone.I still love everything else about this phone. It is speedy. It runs every app I throw at it well. I wish I had gone for the 32 GB version now that I am trying out a bunch of new games that hog up my storage space (and you cant move apps to your sd card either). So I updated my review and gave the phone 4 stars instead of 2. Since I don't use the GPS, and since it is helping me on Pokemon Go, I am only removing 1 star for the GPS issue I still have.","5","helpful"

"Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty","Motorola","249","4","I never write reviews, but I felt compelled to write one for this phone. I had the 1st edition Moto G prior to this one. I do like this phone a lot, but wish it was smaller like the 1st edition I traded up from. I am still trying to get used to the camera adjustment for low light. It's a great feature, but if you need to take a picture quickly like I did, most likely the lighting will not be correct.I was also not able to find any cases for this phone locally and bought a case through Amazon that did not fit properly. Though returns were easy for the case, I was without one until a new case was shipped.I have Cricket Wireless service, which works well with this unlocked phone. Apparently this phone does have a slight glitch with photo messages from time to time according to Cricket where you will have to reset your APN to default for the pictures to complete downloading. Initially it worked, but after a few days usage somehow it would not allow the download. It was a simple fix, and I am hoping it will not happen often.","5","helpful"
"Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty","Motorola","249","5","I think it is worth sharing my story so you can learn from my lessons. I had an ""inexpensive"" model G3 Vigor phone from my cell provider. That in itself was a mistake, a low grade phone for $354.99. In addition I got the insurance for $11.00 per month. Over the course of 18 months the phone slowly degraded: first Bluetooth randomly disconnected from my car and Bluetooth speaker, then the phone ran out of memory so I got an SD card for pictures and video, then calls started dropping, and performance kept degrading to the point where it took a few seconds to pull up the home screen and I had to keep closing apps to get it to perform at least reasonably. I finally had enough and made an insurance claim which was accepted but with a $25 deductible. The replacement phone was a slightly lesser model of phone: an ""Escape 2"" which came with so much bloatware from my carrier I couldn't even install my regular applications. This ""newer"" phone was slower than the original. The overall experience was quite frustrating. So I decided to do my homework and after much research of mid-grade phones I decided on the Moto G4 Plus.I picked up the top unlocked model available in July 2016: 64Gb and 4Gb RAM bundled with a $50 Amazon gift card for $299 so I essentially go the phone for $249. Now that's inexpensive! The phone has 54 Gb available storage with 10Gb reserved for the OS. The octa-core processor and 4Gb of RAM make this baby scream: I keep several applications open at the same time and fly between them without pause. The camera has some very nice features for a phone at this price point perhaps the only desired feature would be image stabilization, but most phones with that feature start at twice the cost of this one. The pictures are much nicer than with my more expensive G3 Vigor, and other phones I've used: S5, G3. The plus has a fingerprint reader which is awesome for unlocking the screen. After training the fingerprint reader I just touch my thumb on it and the phone instantly unlocks, wicked cool!There are two lacking of the G4 Plus in my estimation: Only 1080p video at a time when phones are starting to record 4K and pretty crummy internal speakers, they work great for phone calls but music sounds pretty tinny. To be fair I haven't heard a phone whose speakers had me impressed, but I have heard better from other phones. That said, I use a Bluetooth speaker for music which sounds great.As for insurance, I don't think it's worth the price when you consider the deductible. I will put $20 away each month ($11 of that comes from the $ I saved cancelling the crummy insurance plan.) By the end of 18 months I'll have enough saved to replace the phone","5","helpful"
"Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty","Motorola","249","4","I went back and forth in my decision to buy this slightly more expensive version, or go with the regular Moto G. This won out, since the spec's were better (more RAM, memory, better mp camera, fingerprint sensor). I chose the $50 gift card bundle, and after checkout the phone itself totaled $249 (+ tax which was about $13). The gift card arrived the next day, allowing me to buy accessories for my phone!First of all, I've been a long time Tracfone user, and have only used TF certified phones in the past.Since TF now has a BYOP (Bring Your Own Phone) plan, it made more sense to buy an unlocked phone with up-to-date technology (and no restriction on updating Android).Setup was relatively easy. I purchased the BYOP SIM kit from Walmart, and used the CDMA 4G network card (the mini sim). I decided not to port my old TF phone number, so setup (via my account on Tracfone) was lightning fast. Within a couple of minutes, my phone number, and minutes were ported to my phone. (I'm happy to say that the regular Tracfone minutes cards WILL triple. However, I don't believe the ""Smartphone"" designated cards will.) My phone screen shows that I'm on the Verizon 4G network. In order to access my minutes/text/data balance, I had to d/l the Tracfone app. for that (through Google Play).For whatever reason I was unable to get a proper wireless signal from my current router (I've never used the wireless, only the wired Ethernet portion, so I'm not exactly sure sure if it's just a problem with my router configuration or what. I may have to contact my provider about it.)As a work around I purchased the ""Plugable USB OTG Micro-B Ethernet Adaptor"" (via Amazon). It came today, and it immediately worked upon connection.The only odd thing was after downloading 2 Google Play App's, the app's themselves needed further downloading upon opening (basically they're shell programs, with customizable options upon startup), and it didn't recognize that I had internet due to my data and wireless being turned off, so I guess I will have to finish upgrading the app. when I get to a wireless signal, or buy more data minutes).The camera is a huge plus for me, as my regular Canon digital has the same mp as this internal camera (16). I've already taken a bunch of pictures with it, and I can say that it's slightly better than my Canon in some respects.We had a storm yesterday, and I was able to capture a lightning strike!

"Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty","Motorola","249","4","My initial impression of the Moto G4 Plus after a few days of use is pretty good.Coming from an older LG G2, one of the first things I noticed is the larger size of 5.5ΓÇ¥ compared to the smaller 5.2ΓÇ¥ of the LG. On paper, this difference does not seem like much, but in real world experience it does make it somewhat more difficult to hold and handle with the Moto. Pulling and storing the Moto in the front pant pocket is more difficult as well, but itΓÇÖs not a deal breaker for me, but more of something to get use to as many phones seem to be around the 5.5ΓÇ¥ size these days.When it comes to grip, the matte back of the phone is somewhat grippy but not quite enough for me. I prefer to use a phone without a case, but I will be using a case on this phone mainly because of the smooth bezels on the side of the phone which just make it a bit to slippery for daily use. The build quality seems top notch for a phone in the $250-$300 price range. I like that the back cover can easily be pried open for access to the SIM card(micro SIM slot with an included adapter to fit a nano SIM) plus a Micro SD up to 128GB of storage. With the 64GB model, there is plenty of space for files, music, photos, apps etc. but itΓÇÖs nice to see the optional storage made available. ItΓÇÖs a bummer that the battery is non-removable though. The ports(3.5mm and micro usb) are accessible, but I would have preferred that the headphone jack was placed on the bottom with the charging port. The screen seems durable with thin bezels on the side, perhaps a little too thin for me, but not a deal breaker though. There is a slight lip around the screen that allows you to place the phone face-down on a flat surface without concern of scratches.I do like the front-facing speaker at the top, which gets very loud at full volume without sounding tinny or crackly when playing audio. However, I did notice that the speaker phone did not sound as rich and full when it came to phone calls which is disappointing. The power and volume buttons on the right side are good and clicky with the power button having a textured surface compared to the smooth surface of the volume rocker. The only slight con for me is that the buttons are placed too close to each other and seemed switched in placement compared to many other phones out there. The fingerprint sensor on the front works exceptionally well. ItΓÇÖs accurate and fast. ItΓÇÖs probably twice as fast as my ipad Air 2 sensor. There is almost no delay and works in .5 seconds in my testing. I wish the sensor was placed on the back of the phone perhaps where the Moto emblem dimple is, but that is personal preference. One thing to note is that the fingerprint sensor serves no other purpose other than to unlock the phone. I wish Lenovo had built some other features into the fingerprint sensor like other companies have done and they seemed to have scrimped on this.When it comes to Marshmallow 6.0, IΓÇÖm impressed with the features and with the additional custom hand gesture features for example that Moto brings to the phone. It does seem a little light in custom features compared to what LG has done on their phones though. There is next to no bloatware on the phone which is nice but it does lack some common apps like a calculator and a music player, but this can be easily remedied by downloading free apps from the Play Store. Overall, the phone operates smoothly while scrolling, swiping, texting, and switching between apps. Texting or swiping on the included Google keyboard app works really well, which is a definite plus for me. Multi-tasking on the phone works like a breeze. The Qualcomm 617 octa core processor and 4gb RAM tackles most tasks fairly well for a mid-range processor. Casual gaming works well enough and seems power-efficient thanks to Android 6.0ΓÇÖs power-saving features. The full HD screen is bright and vibrant and works well enough for me. It wonΓÇÖt rival any OLED screen from Samsung or the like, but then again itΓÇÖs less than half the price of those flagship phones, so it's not expected to. IΓÇÖm not sure yet how well the brightness is in broad daylight, but I suspect at full brightness it will be sufficient for me. The turbo-charging seems to work well as advertised too.Overall, this is a nice 2016 phone with a current OS, 32GB storage, 4GB RAM, speedy processor, full HD screen, timely security updates, Android N upgrade-able and is virtually free of bloatware. At the $250-$300 price range, this is really a no-brainer for a budget to mid-range phone and should be on any personΓÇÖs shopping list. With only a few minor cons for me, I still recommend the Moto G4 Plus for anyone looking for an affordable phone. 4.5/5 stars.","5","helpful"

"New Nokia Lumia 1320 GSM Unlocked LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black (No Warranty)","Nokia","99.99","5","Beside windows 8 and 8.1's store lacking some apps the phone is amazing. Being mostly an android user, and before this being on iPhone 5, this phone was very easy to get used to. I loved my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and this phone, if you like large phones, is perfect. Not as big as the Sony Xperia Z Ultra, which is a little too big, but nicely larger then the note 2. The home screen is a little weird to get used too if you are not used to windows 8 on a computer or tablet, but it becomes very handy as you get to choose what you want on the home screen and what you dont want, plus you get to pick from a nice group of colors for your theme. The app drawer when you swipe left is great with a nice search list. The 720p screen isn't as bad as people think, everyone thinks its all about pixels, but you can get nice crisp 720p screens, just like this phone has. With Nokia Black colors on this phone stand out and you get great viewing angles and outside the screen is just as nice, Nokia has done great with there black screen technology. Another thing Nokia has done well is built this phone, but Nokia has a great reputation and builds all there phones like mini tanks!! They also have great battery life. The only minor downfall of Windows Phone is the small lack of apps and games, but the store is growing everyday so that shouldn't last long.Pros: -Build Quality -Large crisp screen -Windows Phone is a great android alternative, especially since its growing and growing everyday.* -Batter Life, can get 2+ days with moderate use, 1 to 1 1/2 days with heaver use. -Camera button, i love having the separate button for just the camera.Cons: -Windows Phone, at the time of this review, lacks some games and apps that android has.Overall i would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a break from android or just wants a whole new experience with this great phone! Coming from IOS to this was a great change and i would have to say, between android and WP8 i would have to say with WP growing and growing WP8 has to be my new favorite OS!!","5","helpful"

"Nokia 220 RM-971 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2MP Camera (Black)","Nokia","174.1","2","Darn hard to open the back cover; in fact, I couldn't open it without taking atool to it which would most likely ruin the product. I had to return it for the Nokia X3-02 model, which I already have and the new one would be used for another carrier SIM card. I am providing a review of my limited but informative experience.The 220 is bigger than it looks (I was hoping it would be the size of the Motorola Rockr (a well built phone--couldn't find batteries for it anymore)). It is light and the complete back casing where the phone's face snaps into the rear housing-case is good at eliminating dirt and what-not that tends to get into the back of phones. It feels like a $50 phone; buttons feels a little cheap--not cheap but a little cheap--like $50 cheap. There is no open anywhere else other than for the charger and headphone jacks. Here's the problem this phone posed for me that make it not workable for my purposes: I do not like to ""transfer"" my files on the SD micro card; I like to pop it out of the phone, insert it into a thumb USB drive and plug it into my computer to open (I avoid all the registering, logging in here and there, updates that and this, tracking me here and there, and all the other pain in the butt trailer tagging electronic vendors tie to your every move/use. So access to the SD card is often and since I couldn't even open the back cover off to put the phone's battery it, (if you have joint problems or joint issues this phone is not for you) well, it wouldn't work for me. It looks like a snap on video, but it's a serious impediment in real life, and I'm no weakling--I'm sure I could open it with the beyond normally required force, but I could have snap or break something inside rendering it less desirable. If I have to exert more than normally required, it would not work for me who routinely removes the SD card. For me, regardless of how well it functions, for my purposes, the hard to open back cover was the deal breaker.I already have a Nokia X3-02 and that's a great phone; really thin, super sleek; I don't care what phone you have, when I pull the X3-02 out, I get double looks. I just didn't want to have two of the same, but it looks like that's my only option in the unlock GMS candy-bar style.","5","helpful"

I have had many phones before, but this one comes with many great features. I am very happy that I made the purchase. I bought it due because I needed a phone on a GSM network. And only AT&T and T Mobile are on those networks. I travel to Europe mostly and South America and Japan on occasion and I needed to have a phone that would work in all of those locations. I found the manual a bit difficult to understand initially, but with time the features and function are great! I am very satisfied with my choice. The phone does require patience if you are not a Blackberry person! I was not. The sound and volume of the calls is great! I had previously used LG and Sony Ericsson And I would have trouble hearing my phone ring if I had it inside a purse or backpack and even my pocket.

It was great for about a week, then it started to demand I insert a SIM card, when there was one in it that had been working.I checked online and this seems to be a known issue with the E71 that Nokia is not addressing.The phone is great when it works, the qwerty works well, easy to use and dial numbers on. 4 days of battery life, all the fans of this phone are correct.But if it does not work it is worthless.I tried cleaning the SIM card contacts with an eraser and alcohol, improving battery contacts, even resetting the phone to factory defaults. Nothing fixed the problem. Yet the same SIM chip fired up without a problem in the E75 every time I swapped it back.So I am returning the E71 to Amazon. Too bad, if it had worked it would have been a great phone.","5","helpful"

It's not easy to open the battery case or the SIM compartment. It's not impossible, but it should be easier.When playing music, the phone has a ""ghost skip"" every 10 seconds or so. By this I mean it cuts out for a fraction of a second. Consistently. It is distracting.The operational software is antiquated. It's not super easy to navigate to media player, for example.

"Nokia X3-02 Factory Unlocked Touch and Type GSM Phone - Dark Metal (International Version) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","Nokia","264.1","4","PROS-This phone is what you want if you use a PHONE.I tried MANY phones -from- AT&T (and returned all of them) wanting a phone I could use for phone calls. ALL of them -would not- allow me to call my WIRED TELEPHONE ANSWERER and pick up messages. These were called SMART PHONES but they -would not- allow me to punch in a code for the answerer in order to retrieve my messages.The SMART PHONES just would not allow me to enter the numbers and pick up messages. I'm no dummy and tried every way I could to retrieve messages. It seems they block key entry when calling.This phone has a KEYPAD -and- a TOUCH SCREEN. You can use EITHER, so you are not -locked out- from pushing numbers after calling, yet you can use the TOUCH SCREEN to do other things.The phone is VERY intuitive and allows you to do SMART PHONE things if you want.The battery life is good, similar to my old Motorola.The 5 mb camera/video is good but not excellent for a cell phone.CONS-The USB port -charging- is funky. The TOP indicator (on the phone) indicates you are CHARGING when connected but you may NOT be unless your PC -recognizes- your phone. So you have a CHARGE indicated on the TOP indicator but the phone POPS UP a message saying PHONE NOT FULLY CHARGED, kind of weird.The Nokia PC software like Nokia PC Suite or OVI Suite are IMHO pretty much useless. They don't seem to work with this phone and get DRIVER ERRORS when I installed them. I contacted Nokia with no help.The plus side is you can connect the phone to W7 and MANUALLY transfer most things. I'm not sure how this will work with my CONTACTS -if- I ever want to RESTORE them to a phone. The Motorola allowed me to do this very simply. I could keep a backup on my PC with little effort.Except for the CONTACTS BACKUP - this is a great phone.","5","helpful"
"Nokia X6 Touch Unlocked GSM Phone with 5 MP Camera and 16 GB Memory (White with Yellow Cap)","Nokia","199","4","I got this phone to replace my Nexus one because of AT&T, I have owned Nokia phones for over four years and have had many N series phones. The X6 is a improvement over the other touch screen phones they make, my N97 mini was just marginal and the 5800 was a disaster with others falling in between that, I would have loved to keep my N1 but refuse to pay $30.00 a month for data on a phone that AT&T does not sell, that is why I went back to Nokia and the X6. The X6 touch screen has been improved with kinetic scrolling but it still suffers from poor touch response!I find this somewhat annoying but livable,the screen is bright and clear but not as good looking as a AMOLED screen but then again the X6 does not suffer from burn in like the AMOLED screens do.The flimsey back cover is a disapointment it feels like it will break very easy if not careful, also the three hard point buttons on the front are a worthless design that I am sure will give you trouble in the future, again poorly built. Battery life is marginal at best!!!Call quality is the same as all Nokia phones, it is clear and has great sound, the twin speakers on the phone give it a really good sound when playing music. The bluetooth works great and is very clear and will support voice dialing from the headset if the headset supports it.All in all Nokia has improved the touch screen phone some what, but still have a long way to go, maybe the new symbian 3 on the N8 will bring them up to where they should have been long ago. I think that the limit of only 16GB internal memory is a mistake, I thought that Nokia would have learned that lesson when they made the N95 8GB but I guess not, they should have at least put a HCSD slot in the phone also but I guess not. Also a little better processor would have been better, the lack of power is a little disappointing but again livable!!! All in all it is a typical Nokia with all the short comings that are typical Nokia, something I have come to expect over the years!!!Would I recommend this phone to others?? Yes but with the stipulation that they do not have visions of iphone or Android N1 to compare to because it will fall well short of the mark. For a Nokia touch screen phone it is as good as they get, if not for the kinetic scrolling it would have probably only gotten two or three stars at best!!! I guess it will hold me over until something better comes along!!!!","5","helpful"
"OnePlus Two 64GB Black, Unlocked Smartphone - International Stock, No Warranty","BLU","279.99","1","After waiting weeks for an invite, I finally broke down and decided to purchase this phone on Amazon. This is one of the worst decisions I have ever made. First of all, I was sent the A2001 Chinese version which runs Hydrogen OS. That means you get a phone that does not have Google services installed. That was the first of many problems. The fingerprint sensor is buggy and works only half the time. Charging takes forever. The camera is terrible. The optical image stabilization almost never works. The phone never slowed down or got too hot but that was because the processor was being throttled viciously. The last straw was when the power button stopped working which made turning the screen on and off a huge hassle. I am returning this phone and will never buy a OnePlus product ever again!","5","helpful"

In the end tho I felt as if I would be happier with a Moto X (and I am) mostly because I just did not feel like I put the keyboard to use, as good as it is, because I have become so efficient with the Google keyboard. I gave this phone to my dad because he missed his Blackberrys of old. He loves this phone.

"Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-i9195i Unlocked Cellphone, Retail Packaging, White Frost","Samsung","276.37","5","Phone is quick, responsive, easy to use - intuitive, but packed with options. Great screen, too. For those who got used to On button on the top, this phone come with the button on the side (that's becoming standard). The only drag is the battery - so keep a charger close to you / battery barely lasts a day (but, I am a heavy user). Also, if you are suffering from SFS or FFS (short finger syndrome or fat finger syndrome) like I do (I wear gloves size 8), then take a note: this is the last phone size that feels comfortable (4.3 in). Headphones are good and clear, but just a bit short for me (that's a matter of taste and practicality). What else... I guess that's it for now / been using it for less then a week.","5","helpful"

"Samsung T959 Galaxy S Vibrant 4G GSM Unlocked Android Smartphone","Samsung","69.99","5","Recived this phone. Works perfect. No problems. Have not yet checked the unlocked part as I plan to use internationally when I travel with other countries sim cards in the phone I. Works perfect with the prepaid tmob acct- $70/month for unlimited data, text, talk. Thats the best deal around. Buy an iphone and pay perhaps $120 or more for the same services (probably much more actally) or this. Pay for the phone in a few months. Insurder it for $58/yr with ensquared. DId an amazing amount of research and feel this is the best bang for the buck. The near $400 is tough upfront, but its the best investment youll make. Have to admit comming from Itunes and iphone, Android is not as easy and more fiddly, but also more customizable. My previous tmobile pay as you go sim went right in and then I upgraded that acct to the all you can have acct online without talking to anyone. Very easy and quick, same number and all. Would recommend this phone and plan.","5","helpful"
"Samsung T989 Galaxy S II 4G Unlocked GSM Smartphone with 8 MP Camera, Android OS, 16 GB Internal Memory, Touchscreen, Wi-Fi, and GPS (Black)","Samsung","69.5","5","This is my second smart phone and first Galaxy. I came off an HTC Incredible with Verizon so let me list the positives and negatives.Positives:1) Came with Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, a marvelous upgrade and a quad core processor which produces very fast uploads and downloads2) Allows me to run Google Chrome, a very fast and versatile browser3) Unlocked and open version, allowing me to insert differing GSM Sim cards if I go to another country4) Booted up with a Koodo (a Cabadian provider) label. I feared it night be locked, but upon inserting a T-Mobile SIM, immediately reognized it. Went to Settings>More>Mobile Networks>Network Operators and selected T-Mobile, the provider I am using, also showed ATT was available if I decide to change5) Very fast, be warned that if you are using T-Mobile it will not show 4G, instead H+, lots of arguments about true 4G6) Allows acceptance of up to a 32GB micro SDHC, an advantage I think over the Samsung Galaxy SIII7) Good battery life, I was surprised that I could surf and e-mail on wifi for 12 hours without recharging and still had about 40 percent left8) Crisp and bright screen, easily readable even with reduced brightness9) Dual screen e-mailer, allowing a view of e-mails without opening10)Frees me from Verizon's continual contract negations upon upgrading and from a contract period when I enrolled with T-Mobile. Verizon is good, but too expensive for my blood. We'll see how I get along with T-Mobile since 95 percent of my use is in my home11) Easily rootable, allowing complete backups, tethering and other niceties12) Seller's description and service were spot on. Phone was new and in original packagingNegatives1) This is a GSM phone and GSM is noted for poor reception inside buildings2) Both T-Mobile and ATT do not have the coverage that Verizon does, so you are paying a price if you expect to use it inside a concrete structure or in a low reception area3) On/Off button is poorly placed on upper right hand side, resulting in inadvertent ons and offs4) The sleek design is also slick, and phone is easily dropped because it is thin and hard to grasp. Correct by encasing in a silicone case5) The back cover is a very thin plastic, also corrected by a case6) I live in a dead spot area, will correct by the addition of a Wilson Electronics-DT-Cell Phone Signal Booster for Small Home or Office. I'll review it separately when installedOverall ImpressionJust a marvelous phone, regardless of the provider","5","helpful"

"Sony Ericsson K790a Phone (Unlocked)","Sony Ericsson Mobile","26.5","5","I received this phone about 2 months ago and am very pleased with its photo capabilities. The 3.2 mp photos it produces, both indoors and outside, are good enough in most instances for printing as well as emailing. I've found it very convenient to have the capability to take reasonably good pictures available in combination with my phone. I carry the phone in a soft plastic case used for reading glasses and it fits perfectly and protects the phone from scratches. While it is longer than my old LG clamshell, it is thinner and therefore more comfortable to carry around in my pocket. The included USB cable makes downloading photos very quick and easy. The only thing I dislike about the phone is that the lens cover does not lock in place and seems to work its way to the open position frequently. While this causes the phone to go into ""picture taking mode"" temporarily, it quickly goes back into sleep mode while in its case and does not exhaust the battery. As it is protected in its case I don't really have any concerns about damage to the lens, however, it would be nice if the lens cover locked a little more securely.","5","helpful"
"Sony Ericsson W810i Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP Camera, MP3/Video Player, Memory Stick Duo--International Version with No Warranty (Black)","Sony Ericsson Mobile","99","5","I used to use Nokia phones until last December, when the Sony w600i came. That was another great phone also. I recently spied the w810i here and found it to look most intriguing. I liked the design of it for starters; clean elegant lines and a stately satin black with small touches of Walkman orange make for an attractive phone.The layout is very intuitive and uncomplicated. This phone seemingly does it all. The pictures are the best I have ever seen from a camera phone, and with the included software (actually download the software from the website to make sure you have the newest version) sending your pictures to your pc is fast and easy via Bluetooth. It also synchronizes nicely with outlook, again with the convenience of Bluetooth. However, you will need to use the cable for importing your music.Now that were on the subject of music, the first thing I did, and you should too, is to put the included 512MB Memory Stick PRO Duo aside and buy a 2GB Stick. I imported 169 songs into the phone at 128kps and I still have over 1.2GB worth of space remaining on the Stick. Wow, that will hold a lot of pictures, videos and more songs!!!I know I should also list the shortcomings here, but I honestly could not find any. I will not list shortcomings that defy the laws of physics as some people do; ""the buttons are too small"", or if it is not that it's ""the phone is too big"". Am I missing something here? How can it be both ways? Actually, there is one thing that a few people have mentioned and that is that the earpiece volume can be a tad to low on some calls. But this is a small percentage of calls.This is a great high-end phone that you will be proud to own.","5","helpful"
"Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)","Sony","269.1","3","This phone is unbranded (meaning you cannot get it from your local at&t or T-Mobile store here in the U.S.) So since the phone is unbranded forget about customer service help from your wireless carrier. All they tell you is contact Sony Ericsson. When you call Sony Ericsson customer service, they're very arrogant, and all they try to do is to let you use their support page on their website.The phone is good looking and solid, however many reviewers in other places [...] have returned their phone due to faulty battery cover that wobbles, and the kickstand is loose and doesn't stay in place. Unfortunately these problem occurs when your 30 days are up and you cannot return your product for a full refund!SE claims a 8.1 megapixel camera, but that is far from taking great pictures, at best their okay!The case IC-45 that SE offers for the phone is generic (meaning not specially made for this model) and when you put the phone in there the latch doesn't close and you have to force it. Forcing it touches the off button and your phone is off without you knowing it. The belt case is made of plastic that is very hard to use and that it can break easily!The GPS program that come pre-installed is Wayfinder, and it's a European company not even comparable to Tomtom, Garmin. Telenav doesn't offer a program for this specific model and their CS is another story.So basically you're paying for a great looking phone without any support from your carrier and SE.The music player (Walkman) is great and sounds great! Youtube application doesn't work, you have to mess with the firmware and it's not recommended for none tech savvy people! (this is where you find that at&t doesn't care since it's not their branded phone and SE doesn't care since they really don't care after they sell you the device, and they tell you you should contact your carrier!).So, bottom line if you're tech savvy, you have $450+ to burn, and you change phone often then yes buy this phone by all mean. However if you want tech support, cheaper phone, buy a branded version from your own wireless carrier.[...]","5","helpful"

The screen, sure it looks small, but when you compare it to the Iphone it is just a little smaller, and does not have all the bulkiness that an Iphone has. Another thing do not be afraid of the words International Version, many of these phones will come from the middle east and that is why that term. Note, because they come from the middle east their android marketplace is restricted to nothing. Easy fix, many of the phones will come pre-installed with android 1.6 on them, so simply download pc companion on your computer by inserting the provided data cable into the computer, and then you have android 2.1, which also features the android marketplace, and a few other tweaks here and there. I would recommend getting some kind of skin or cover to prevent your phone from scratching, as well as screen protectors.","5","helpful"

It was tough finding a decent phone of medium size which is unlocked, this was definitely the best choice. I really like the layout and flexibility Sony has built in to their UI. There are a few things that are not preferable, but overall I can live with. It gets good reception and is quick. I am disappointed with the camera performance (my 3 year old Nexus S has much clearer pictures) and how the default album view is all one large album, versus the stock Android view which is separate albums. I do really appreciate the sd slot which allows me to add extra storage, as opposed being locked into only 16GB of the Nexus 4. FYI. Don't worry about the screen being old TFT technology, it's really clear with good viewing angles.","5","helpful"

"Verizon Wireless 4G LTE MICRO SIM Card 3FF - Brand New and Unused","Verizon","3.5","1","I chose this rating not because of the card itself but because Amazon sent the wrong card. Like most of you I ordered an OEM version of the Verizon micro SIM. Instead I got the 4G LTE certified version. That wouldn't annoy me so much if the OEM version wasn't quadruple the price AND we didn't need the cards as soon as possible for an upcoming trip.So basically the old bait and switch is at play here. I contacted Amazon customer service via chat and was told that ""that usually never happens""--which again is not true especially since there are other reviewers who have mentioned said bait and switch. The service rep was nice enough to ""help"" me manufacture a label so that I could take my time to run to UPS and return said incorrect items. And then I was advised to order the cards again...in hopes that the next time around I will receive the right product.Needless to say, the product will arrive after I actually have need to put it in my new phone. In any event, I will try to post an update after the card arrives to say if it worked as intended.","5","helpful"

"VIVO IV Full HD Super Amoled,13MP,(16GB+2GBRAM)-Factory Unlocked (White Silver)","BLU","209.99","2","For 300 bucks its a good deal. But lack of LTE and lack of updates is not worth it. KitKat was promised to the device in June, now its pending and postponed update. This phone needs an update bad. Lags for no reason and freezes. I returned the product after a week. And in that week, I had 2 occasions where I had to do a hard reset. Internal storage is 16GB but you only actually have about 9GB to play with/ or something like that. They separate internal storage and app storage (so weird) Camera back and front is good. Really good. Battery is OK. Their is a weird bug where the battery will drop to 80% on a full charge in the first 10 minutes then hover for hours around 50%...I don't know whats up with that. Phone does get hot. I don't even play games, but just multitasking several apps gets noticeable hot. Now with that said, I didn't like it and I can not recommend the phone at all. With the lack of updates from BLU (which all seems to be software related) The user experience for 300 dollars is better elsewhere. Its a beautiful device, well constructed, just an awesome build. But the software will either sink or swim this phone. And the software is drowning the phone everyday it doesn't get KitKat.","5","helpful"
"VIVO IV Full HD Super Amoled,13MP,(16GB+2GBRAM)-Factory Unlocked (White Silver)","BLU","209.99","5","Had this phone for a couple of months & so far have been very impressed. I was a bit skeptical buying a Blu phone (this one being a rebranded Chinese Gionee Elife s5.1) but so far no major issues. I definitely would recommend it to anyone looking for a high-end smartphone but not wanting to spend ~$600.Pros:* Screen: very bright & lots of pixels for sharp images* Battery: when I 1st got the phone, it would lose 1% for every minute the screen was on but since, Blu pushed out an update that resolved this issue & the battery lasts a long time* Specs: the octacore processor & 2gb of RAM make the phone pretty snappy altho it does lag once in a while* Camera: the camera takes great photos/videos* Extras: comes with a screen protector (be warned that it is the exact width but a little shorter in length than the phone so make sure you center it correctly when applying) & case (very thin & does not offer a lot of protection; also bluish in color)* Updates: Blu has pushed out 2 updates to my phone so far so they are still supporting/working on the phone* Price: much cheaper than buying a similar phone from a bigger brand* Size: remarkably thing & light for a 5"" phone* Rocket: not sure what to call it but there is a green rocket you can press on the notifications screen that will free up RAM* Antennae: this phone does a much better job of picking up & keeping wifi & phone signals unlike my last Samsung phone which would constantly drop & reconnect* Mine came with KitKat already installed, no update necessaryCons:* Launcher: the Amigo launcher is just icons & a weather widget; downloaded Nova Launcher to make the phone more like the usual Android experience; had to download a calendar & message widget as there were no defaults as on my other Android phones* Size: the large screen is nice but makes one-handed use a little difficult; thinness also makes it a little difficult to grip at times* Accessories: there are not many out there for this phone; BLU finally made a case (other than the one that comes with) but it applies pressure to the power button & forces the phone to constantly reboot* Buttons: everything is the opposite of what I am used to (buttons on the left instead of right; ear jack on top while power on the bottom; back button on the right while settings button the left)* Volume: speakerphone is not that loud; the lowest ringer/notification level is a rather loud* Unlocking: after drawing the pattern to unlock my phone, I still have to swipe up which seems unnecessary (might be due to adding the Nova Launcher)* Customer Service: tried to call Blu a couple of times & gave up after being on hold forever; sent an email and never heard back* Storage: there is no micro SD expansion slot but the 16gb is plenty for me* LTE: will not work on T-Mobile's 4G LTE but the 4G speed is fast enough IMHO* Call Screen: I guess my face hits the necessary buttons but I am constantly making phone calls while on a call & also recording them unintentionally* Box: there was no seal so it was not easy to tell if the phone was used/open-box; however I have not had any problems with the phone. Would be nice if they sealed it shut so the buyer knows it has not been used.","5","helpful"

The phone overheats when charging, and downloading updates. There was a small 42mb update and the phone heated up to 105 f. The back of the phone was very hot to the touch. During a large update it would probably shut down or burn out. At the least the life of the phone would be cut way short from the overheating. Also there is an extra button on the right bottom for the camera. The camera would come on with the phone in my pocket.

If you watch the battery level for a few moments you can see it go down, even with NOTHING ELSE RUNNING.There is a plethora (great word) of settings to reduce battery life but what do they do? what are the consequences of using them, BEATS ME.I estimate that the battery life when the phone is in standby mode, NO calls, NO videos, NO music, NO browsing, NOTHING, IS BARELY 12 hours.If you ACTUALLY USE IT, then the battery life drops rapidly.I am going to RELUCTANTLY return the phone and go back to my MOTO X gen 1 which gives 24 hrs of moderate use.I will watch ZTE to see if they can improve this, the Axon 7 is truly a great phone but as of now they should include a hand cart to carry the necessary batteries.","5","helpful"

My friend has had a 6"" ZTE phone from Cricket for quite a while and she has been very impressed with it, but it was the high-end specs (2k display, real HiFi, and advanced camera) at such a great price that got my attention. I have not been disappointed :-)First of all I have to say the display is fantastic. Very bright, great colors and extremely sharp with very good contrast. The hifi and has blown me away. I certainly had high expectations and I am a real music-head, but the HiFi quality on this phone is amazing. It is without any doubt the best real hifi player I have ever had. The JBL ear-buds that were in the box are good (JBL after all), but it is when I use my Shure's that I really get to hear how extraordinary the hifi is on this phone, even when I use the on-board Dolby.As for the camera, I have only had the phone a few days, so not yet enough time to delve deep into all of the advanced features, but it does have good rear and front cameras, with very easy to use in-built features for snappers and pro smudgers too. I especially like the post snap refocus (bokeh).

The octa-core processor is responsive and apps load quickly. The clever 2-camera setup takes awesome pictures in full sunlight and pretty good pictures in low light. The screen resolution is the best I've seen on any ZTE phone and on many phones overall. And the phone charges faster than any phone I've ever had. These features and 64gb of storage for this price is such a better value than what you get from Apple and Samsung.That said, all that power does burn through the battery very quickly. If you know you're not going to be able to recharge and that you're going to need the phone all day, then the available battery save mode is absolutely required. Just sitting the phone on my desk without any activity for a couple of hours can burn 10% or more off the battery, even though I've not directly used it..However, because of the super fast charging capability, the battery usage is not a deal killer. The thing that might be is the phone's issues with my mobile provider. On the one hand, sitting in my driveway the afternoon I got the service, the phone did a speed test that topped out at 119mbps down. I was absolutely floored. I'd never seen such performance. I thought I'd finally come up with the best combination of phone hardware and (low-cost) mobile service provider.Then I went on vacation. We went to the ""Crystal Coast"" of North Carolina. And my shiny new phone was in brick mode all week. It seems obvious that the network would be the issue, being out on a barrier island and all. But two other folks in my party with the same service (one with an iPhone the other with a low-end Samsung smartphone) had at least 1 or 2 bars all week long. My phone was only good over wifi. I only got text messages after driving many miles off the island and either powering the phone off and back on or, more annoyingly, popping the SIM card out and back in.I've still got a ticket open with the mobile provider because I know the phone worked on the island -- I was able to call 611 for customer service using the phone, and I was able to call 911 after a lightning bolt set a nearby telephone pole on fire. So I know the radio worked. Maybe the service provider was preventing me from connecting for some reason? But it really begs the question of why folks with different hardware were able to use the service and I was not.On the long ride home from the beach, the mobile coverage is spotty in rural North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. And though all of us lost mobile coverage at various points, the iPhone always seemed to recover without intervention when a signal became available, while I was repeatedly required to pop the sim card out and back in to reset it. If I'd been on a long trip driving alone, I would have just been unavailable and out of luck until I pulled over. For me, this is the deal killer. The phone has got to be resilient to varying network conditions as I travel. First and foremost, it has to at least be a mobile phone. I love that it's high-performing and much more affordable. But if I can't trust it to work when I need it to, I have to question what kind of ""value"" I'm getting.I'm going to wait to find out what the service provider has to say about why I was prevented from connecting to the network out on the island. But the seed of doubt I now have about whether or not I can trust the phone when I'm traveling may be the reason I end up sending it back. It's an elegant, high-performing device in many ways. But if I can't call or send a text message someplace where I know there is coverage, then this attractive, flagship phone isn't a value at any price.I've got another short trip planned, this time to Northern Michigan. If the phone works there like it's supposed to then maybe I'll give it a second chance. But if it fails there as well and is not resilient to the sketchy network conditions in that part of the world, then I'll have no choice but to send it back and try something else.","5","helpful"

"ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Phone, 64 GB Chromium Silver (U.S. Warranty)","ZTE","339","3","There are so many things I like about this phone. The octa-core processor is responsive and apps load quickly. The clever 2-camera setup takes awesome pictures in full sunlight and pretty good pictures in low light. The screen resolution is the best I've seen on any ZTE phone and on many phones overall. And the phone charges faster than any phone I've ever had. These features and 64gb of storage for this price is such a better value than what you get from Apple and Samsung.That said, all that power does burn through the battery very quickly. If you know you're not going to be able to recharge and that you're going to need the phone all day, then the available battery save mode is absolutely required. Just sitting the phone on my desk without any activity for a couple of hours can burn 10% or more off the battery, even though I've not directly used it..However, because of the super fast charging capability, the battery usage is not a deal killer. The thing that might be is the phone's issues with my mobile provider. On the one hand, sitting in my driveway the afternoon I got the service, the phone did a speed test that topped out at 119mbps down. I was absolutely floored. I'd never seen such performance. I thought I'd finally come up with the best combination of phone hardware and (low-cost) mobile service provider.Then I went on vacation. We went to the ""Crystal Coast"" of North Carolina.

"ZTE Axon Pro Factory Unlocked Phone, 64 GB Phthalo Blue (U.S. Warranty)","ZTE","379.98","5","Ok, so I got my new AXON phone a few days ago and I absolutely love it!! I specifically bought this phone to replace my LG G3. My friend has had a 6"" ZTE phone from Cricket for quite a while and she has been very impressed with it, but it was the high-end specs (2k display, real HiFi, and advanced camera) at such a great price that got my attention. I have not been disappointed :-)First of all I have to say the display is fantastic. Very bright, great colors and extremely sharp with very good contrast. The hifi and has blown me away. I certainly had high expectations and I am a real music-head, but the HiFi quality on this phone is amazing. It is without any doubt the best real hifi player I have ever had. The JBL ear-buds that were in the box are good (JBL after all), but it is when I use my Shure's that I really get to hear how extraordinary the hifi is on this phone, even when I use the on-board Dolby.As for the camera, I have only had the phone a few days, so not yet enough time to delve deep into all of the advanced features, but it does have good rear and front cameras, with very easy to use in-built features for snappers and pro smudgers too. I especially like the post snap refocus (bokeh). The best phone camera I have owned previously was my Lumia 1020, but the AXON is very good and I am sure I will get much more from the camera yet.So then very impressive phone at a great unlocked price with truly exceptional warranty:Pros:Uniquely distinctive modern design with lots of real metal used.HiFi (can't say enough good things about it).Great cameras front and rear with excellent features.Beautiful 2k display.Fast and crisply responsive.Great price for what is clearly unlocked flagship phone.Best warranty I have ever seen on a phone.Cons:A bit on the heavy side, but then again it feels very premium. Let's just say much more the feel of a Mercedes AMG Black than a Corvette!The JBL earbuds included in the box are certainly good, but they do not do justice to the phone.","5","helpful"

Also, this Sunday, when we took a few pictures with the sun on back of kids, the pictures from my husband's Galaxy S6 are way worse than my Axon.

"ZTE Sprint S155 Wego Kids Cell Phone","Sprint","21.77","5","This thing is as basic as you can get but it does work. GPS locating is slow and sketchy at best, you must set up the Wego app to pre-program phone numbers that it can call and text. Phone can receive any text from an approved number but only has a list of about 25 pre installed responses that leave it pretty Limited. I do like that it sends a text message notifying me when my message has been read but the notification for when the Panic alarm is pulled takes 2 to 3 minutes which in my opinion is way too long. For my kids that can operate my touchscreen smartphone better than I can the push button on the front with the sides control up and down scroll and back button is a little tricky for them to figure out, and while being able to dial nine-one-one easily should be an enticing feature I find myself wanting to remove it from the phone because they have accidentally dialed it 3 times now by pushing the OK button to fast. Sprint Wego plan is only $10 a month which includes 1000 minutes 1000 texts and of course no data so what it is I think it is a pretty good deal. FYI, pay no attention to the reviews from ""Amazon customer"". I don't know if somebody listed their name as that or Amazon hides their screen name but it seems every time I see it it is multiple reviews which are completely wrong or are advertising the product like it was written by the seller.","5","helpful"

All of my APPS downloaded and installed properly from Google and Amazon app stores and work just as good as on my expensive Tablet. My new ZMAX2 handles even large and Graphically intensive apps with no glitches or problems. I love the large (5 1/2"" viewable) screen with awesome, vibrant display. Also reasonably light weight for it's size and fits fine in my pockets.I do not usually impress easily with new technology devices but this one is a sure winner in my book. And, it cost a fraction of what other comparable devices cost nowadays. I have only had it a few weeks but am very pleased so far. I hope it has a long, reliable life (ha-ha)!","5","helpful"

"ZTE Z222 Unlocked Flip Phone with Camera","ZTE","32.49","1","Phone itself - eh. Basic no brand flip phone. Reason for low rating? Once I installed the SIM card into this phone, no less than 2 weeks later our AT&T account gets hacked. First time purchasing an unlocked flip phone (for my mom, who's a senior citizen and prefers a no-frills phone) who's other phone broke, and now our family plan has unauthorized hacks and brand new iPhone 7's (on an installment plan, of course) all due to this SIM card being hijacked. My advice, skip the purchase and (securely) purchase an overpriced flip phone from your carrier. I would have gladly paid the $50 for an overpriced flip phone from AT&T instead of the $25 I paid from here, knowing the amount of time it has taken me to fix my account and the hours spent on the phone with the Fraud Department.","5","helpful"
