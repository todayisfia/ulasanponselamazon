First two times I was able to reset the phone with the multi-button method. The third time it happened it went berserk and just started a repeating pattern of vibrations (one long a little pause then one short and then a longer pause, etc,) I have tried to find a resolution in the forums and through searches and find that this is more common than I thought. Imagine that, Nokia puts out products that last just 3 months, Shame on you. Microsoft is not without fault here either as the limitations on the OS put many basic Symbian OS functions way ahead of this WP7.8. No multi-file deletion capabilities, no street names in navigation. and many more basics lost in this OS. I will likely have to eat the repairs on this one as the international phone has no warranty.","0","Unhelpful"

A nice affordable price, sleek looking, great qualities. After about 2 weeks the phone froze, and I had to reset it. Not a problem, and I went about using the phone. The battery life is good, the camera is great but for mine it was a little laggy in snapping the picture and I had to press the button a few times in order for it to snap a picture. The case it comes with is perfect, it helped protect my phone the few times it fell. Overall its a great phone, but the freezing happened more often that it should have. I would be in the middle of something and the screen would screw up and I wouldn't be able to exit out of anything or whatnot. Had to stop and reset it. I would say it froze on me at least 2-3 times a month. I used this phone for a good 8 months before I decided to switch to something else. Other than the freezing up, I got great use out of the phone and was satisfied. (the freezing really didn't affect the phone usage, just got annoying when it happened.)","0","Unhelpful"

I fell in love with design and color of the phone and it worked great, especially overseas. However, the silver colored plastic on the face of the phone started peeling (from contact with skin oils, perspiration, etc.) after owning it only 6 months or so. I researched it and other people who contacted Nokia got replacement phones that did the exact same thing within a few months. I was a loyal Nokia customer for over 10 years (my first phone circa 1997 was a Nokia). Needless to say, I am no longer a Nokia customer.","0","Unhelpful"

Then I bought the Lenovo thinking hat it will be water proof. Used it. Went kayaking with it. OK, good. But then one day I went paddle boarding and fell into the water. I fell in and got back on the Paddleboard in less than a minute, but this time water got in. In less then a minute, the screen was dead, and it got very warm. RIP. Dead. I figured out that I didn't press the flap that covered the USB charger port in tight enough, but come on, a cheap THL survived for a month after going in the water for over a minute and this LENOVO completely died in water for less than a minute. They need to work on the flap seal.","0","Unhelpful"

"Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo G903M Duos 16GB - Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging (Gold)","Samsung","451.1","5","Bought the one sold by Amazon (there are two versions of this phone. I got the G903M Duos). It does have 2 sim card ports in the back. It is a little bit ""laggy"" on some applications every now and again. I find that once I run the SD Maid Cleaner app it helps tremendously (Maybe a memory issue). It plays all the games I've tried so far; Pokemon GO and Sim city (not a big gamer). I did get an OTA update to android version 6.0. I'm with T-Mobile and it works great with them including LTE service. I love this phone because it still has a removable battery and its water resistant. It does not have the charging port cover and they went back to the old USB plug instead of the larger one the regular S5's had. It does not have the old IR remote controller for TV's, etc., I do miss that as I used it all the time but worth the trade off for the updated processor. Since I was upgrading from an older S5 one of my primary concerns was whether or not all the old accessories would fit this phone. I am happy to say that everything down to the screen protector is still the same and I did not have to buy any new accessories.","0","Unhelpful"

I'm going a round and around with them and getting furious and frustrated. It's ridiculous. Amazon tells me the only invoice they have is the one they gave me and Motorola said it's not enough. ARGH. They won't honor it and we can't get the phone fixed. The other phone is still working fine and we'd buy another one like it except for the POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.

After using this phone I felt pretty stupid for buying iPhones. It is not that iPhones are not good products, they have just completely priced themselves out of the market. The Blu does everything my iPhone 6s does at a fraction of the cost. It is just as fast and voice recognition is superior to Siri. In comparing to my 6s, the only thing I noticed was wifi speeds top out at about 50 Mbps on the Blu. My iPhone tops out around 500 Mbps. The speed of the iPhone is overkill and there didn't seem to be any difference in web browsing. From everything I can tell, this phone is every bit as good as my $750 iPhone.","0","Unhelpful"

I did not realize that I was suppose to have some functionality while in the middle of a call, until the phone decided to show me that functionality. It functioned correctly with call-options, such as mute and record, on three occasions. During the malfunctioning state (most of the time), during a call the screen goes black, hiding all the options that it suppose to show. If you check the Nokia site you will find this is a problem (probably related to the proximity sensor).","0","Unhelpful"

The camera is not bad, the processor is decent. What absolutely ruins this phone is the ADWARE GARBAGE attached to it.The Adware does NOTHING (because the ads themselves aren't even sized properly you don't even know what's being promoted) but slows up the phone. It pops up every so often in settings, launching aps etc. Additionally having used close to a dozen MTK phones Lenovo did a poor job of altering the android OS. It's hard to use, not configurable and clunky.And finally I cannot figure out how to change the MMS settings to consolidate group texts - a known problem with earlier generation android phones.I think those that have the time (I don't) to root this phone will have a much better experience. In stock software form it's not better than the other Android phones on the market - despite the slightly lower price.","0","Unhelpful"

"Apple iPhone 6 Plus Silver 16GB Unlocked Smartphone (Certified Refurbished)","","387.99","5","Definitely my favorite iPhone so far! Apple hit a homer with this iPhone! First let me start off by saying this phone has the best battery I have ever had! Phones I've had: Samsung S6, iPhone 6, Nexus 6P, iPhone 5s, NONE of these can keep up with the battery on the iPhone 6 Plus. The camera is good although Samsung does make better cameras, you can always take a great picture with an iPhone. I recommend using google Photos app, there is a pop feature on there that makes your pictures look great. I also recommend the VSCO camera app for editing pictures.iOS runs fantastic on here and apps look beautiful on the larger display. I'd definitely recommend it over the regular 6. Althugh it is more expensive, once you get adjusted to the larger screen you definitely won't want to go back to a small screen. This is 2016, a 4.7 inch display on an iPhone is just too small. So if larger screen and better battery don't sell you, keep in mind the PLUS also has Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). This is an excellent feature which the iPhone 6 lacks and can be quite bothersome if you take pictures/videos of children or dogs because they tend to move and your pictures lose focus. I could not be happier with the iPhone 6 Plus.","0","Unhelpful"

"Sony Xperia XA unlocked smartphone,16GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)","","249.99","5","Delivery took two business days. I chose this phone because of it's gorgeous design. Blending a seamless edge to edge display, thin body width, and a 720x1280 display this phone is definitely unique. (I hope to see more modern phones trending towards more ergonomically friendly designs just because not everyone has mammoth hands)! The rear camera delivers enough while shooting 1080p video and photos @ 13 megapixels, front facing camera has 5 megapixels. The battery life isn't the greatest but that's just what happens when tnt is packed into such a small package. In the end I am willing to sacrifice poor battery life for tremendous style and Xperia Xa dual has just enough features to be more than comfortable @ upper mid tier price range.","0","Unhelpful"

When I contacted the seller, they referred me to Samsung, since the product carried a no warranty notice. I don't think I am up for the run around, so may just count my losses. In future, I have to re-think any purchases with the no warranty notice. We all learn from experience. Only because I trusted Amazon, and never had problems before did I make this purchase.

"Samsung Galaxy A3 Unlocked Cell Phone - Retail Packaging - Midnight Black","Samsung","289.99","4","Excellent phone: light-weight, small enough to put in a pocket even while in a sleeve, superb contrast in display, great battery life, sound quality, and fast processor. Also, Samsung has used its top-of-the-line camera in the phone. It is not designed for heavy gaming, video or music work. My only reservation is that the phone is so new in the U.S. that Verizon (my first choice) was unable to activate it. Samsung hoped to release it last spring to general public, but as of 10/16, they have not done so. On a friend's recommendation, I went to T-Mobile for service They easily made it work. Even then, they had to go to their tech support to find a way to set up voice mail. Within a day, a tech rep was able to send me a sofware patch that made that function work. Warning to potential buyers: My phone came from Amazon. You must buy a phone that can work in the American networks. If a phone is advertised as ""international"" model, (Sweden and Great Britain have had it available for at least 6 months) be sure you have a guarantee that will take it back if it doesn't work.","0","Unhelpful"

Again, they responded with all kinds of verbiage that did not address the issue. I told them I would be sending the phone back, and NOT to write me back. Again, they didn't listen. I called Amazon, and as usual SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Let's just say I was very impressed and surprised on how Amazon dealt with Teczilla and mentioned to me that they could see I am a loyal customer of Amazon. I've had a Palm for 10 years and it is still working strong, and although everyone has a smart phone, I know how to work the Palm, and not interested in having any other phone.

"Sony Xperia X Performance Smartphone Unlocked 4G LTE (Screen: 5"" - 64 GB - Dual Nano-SIM - Android Marshmallow 6.0) (White)","","514.99","3","First, let me start off by saying I am a huge Sony fan. I still use a Sony Vaio aptop, I have the Playstation 4, i have a 32 gb Xperia Z2 Tablet and I had the Xperia Z3 Compact and would still probably buy another Sony product. However, This phone was a disappointment. The battery was wayyyy worse than my Xperia Z3 Compact and after almost 3 years with that phone I would say they both have about the same life expectancy. Not much of an upgrade if you ask me. Now moving on to the speakers. I am not kidding, they packaged this phone very very well so I do not believe there was any shipping damage, The top front stereo speaker is a lot louder than the bottom front stereo speaker. I have researched this problem as well and it seems a lot of owners have reported the same defect. Not sure if all of them do this or it's just this seller. Anyway everything ELSE about the phone is pretty solid. Great great phone and really nice look as well as reliable waterproofing. Not sure why it doesn't use a USB C or thunderbolt 3 though..","0","Unhelpful"

"BLU Tank 3 - GSM Unlocked Dual Sim Cell phone with 1,900 mAh Battery -Grey","","25.36","5","For those of you looking for the most basic features in a phone, you can hardly get any more basic than with this phone. I bought the BLU Tank 3 T430 for its lack of features, long battery life, and low price. It doesn't have anything I would never use in a phone.All I want is to place and receive calls and do simple texting. It has a one-name-one-number contact list without the possibility of adding a birthdate, email, or other useless information. I really like its blacklist feature.I first transferred my contact information to the SIM card using my old phone before inserting the card into my new phone. Once the card is inserted, you can copy your information to the phone's memory. I just left my contacts on the SIM card since SIM cards have a capacity for 250 contacts, and this phone's memory is limited to 100 contacts.It has an FM radio which is nice to have, though unnecessary. It has an auto search feature which will pick up all FM radio stations in your area. You can then edit the name of each station if you wish. Don't count on quality pictures and videos with its VGA camera. It can play audio and video files located on a mini SD card.Opening the back cover is easy if you can get your fingernails in the slot located on the lower right side. It's easy enough to insert a SIM card in the SIM1 slot using the metal tray which has a pull tab on its left side. I didn't try the SIM2 slot. The battery has no pull tab, but comes off easily enough. There's a slot for a mini SD card which you will need to insert should you want to take pictures and videos.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my new phone. It has fewer features than my nine year old flip phone, but one major plus with this phone is that it has no moving parts other than the keypad buttons. I like its big display area, pleasant colors, and loud speaker. I recommend it to anyone who is not technical and has no use for a smartphone, and to anyone who travels frequently. Its dual SIM card capability means you never need to open the back cover again.","0","Unhelpful"

I had a very hard time navigating to the language selection area of the settings, couldn't understand any of it. The charger also came as the European version, which has a different prong system for their outlets. They did however include an adapter for me, which I am grateful for. Now that the language has been set to English I am very satisfied with my purchase. Camera is awesome!

Well a few important things. THIS PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED. Also, IT DOES NOT COME WITH A SIM CARD. So I payed to have my phone unlocked. I purchased a sim card. And now it sort of works. It is a phone, I can make calls and send text messages. I can even connect to wifi networks. But, and this is a big one, IT DOESN'T do anything else. Which you know is sort of the point of a smart phone. Also, it keeps disconnecting from the network. I looked into it, and I guess many other people have this same issue.Don't wast your money.","0","Unhelpful"

There are many options, so you can customize the phone, it has google play store, so you able to download different apps. The touch screen is very responsive. The phone came with a charger, earbuds, battery, screen protector and a clear case. like I mentioned earlier, this phone is a perfect starter phone, especially for those young in age. The downside is the phone does not have a lot of internal memory and no place to add any external memory, so it prevents you want downloading a lot of applications.

I suppose it works in the US with most carriers as it is an unlocked phone. There are several options of displayed languages, including English. It's a budget phone and it's not dissatisfying, however, not a lot of memory for lots of apps installed and it will slow down with more than a few apps running at the same time. However, it does work well for me, inexpensive, used as a phone, WhatsApp works well, GPS maps and calendar. Seller delivered in time, with the right packaging.","0","Unhelpful"

Found out that I just need to talk via headphones or holding the phone to my ear and problem is solved. Otherwise, I love the phone. The camera is great, everything works fine. I was concerned about the reviews I read that said that these phones are not made for America and only work on a couple of the bands that American phones have. This has not been a problem where I am.

Can handle many of the basic smartphone capabilities. Not the beefiest hardware, for example, Snapchat is laggy. And web browsing (tested on multiple browsers) isnt the smoothest. Had to constantly maintain the storage (clear cache, transfer large files to sim card) but its not that big of a deal. Even dropped it a few times and everything was still in tact. Got the phone because i couldn't justify having a ""phone mortgage"" in my mind.Only real complaint is that its all plastic, including the screen, which means the the touch calibration can get thrown off after a while because of bending. Had to gently bend it around a little to ""recalibrate"" it. It's not that big of a deal unless there is something urgent happening, or someone is trying to call you and you cant use your phone because the touchscreen isnt responding correctly.Looking to upgrade because of that. But again, great phone for the price.","0","Unhelpful"

"Blackview BV6000 Waterproof Smartphone IP68 Gorilla Glass 3 Shockproof Dustproof Android 6.0 3GB RAM 32GB ROM 4.7 Inches Outdoor Mobile Cell Phone Green","","216.99","5","Had the phone for just under a month now. Settle in for a long review. I read other reviews before purchasing this phone but admittedly took them with a grain of salt (and am glad I did). My criteria for a new phone were this: 3GB RAM, at least 32 ROM, decent screen resolution, and durability.Connectivity: I use the AT&T network through StraightTalk and had no issue getting my phone connected. If you're struggling ensure you've updated the access point names AND turned on the network data setting. In the area I live I'm only getting 3G but that's not the fault of the phone, that's the fault of the network.Three (Capacitative) Buttons on phone. The left one that is usually the open/recent apps on most phones isn't programmed out of the box to be so. I don't recall exactly what it didn't now but do recall thinking it was effectively the same as the home button. This was almost a deal breaker for me until I found an app (Buttons remapper) to reprogram the button to be recent apps. Later on while digging deep in the settings I found a 3 finger command you could enable to show recent apps but I still prefer remapping the button so stuck with that.One wish, that I need to see if an app would provide, is there is no ""all apps"" option. Your apps are stored across your different screens. Generally I like laying out my screens in a way that fits me but have the all apps in alphabetically order so I can quickly get to lesser used apps. Can't do that with this phone. Again, a minor irritation but not a deal breaker.The SOS button is more sensitive than I'd like so I deactivated it almost immediately after activating it. Also, why would they build an SOS button that loudly and longly declares to the world that you've activated it? If you're truly in serious danger from an individual this is likely to enrage the attacker. This feature has some kinks to be worked out.The phone appears durable but I haven't dropped it yet so don't have feedback on that. The plastic on back looks nice and looks like it has great texture, but it's plastic so doesn't ""stick"" to your fingers, instead it is smooth. I'd prefer this backing be rubber instead of plastic so it would have some grip. Right now I have to keep my pinky finger under the phone so it doesn't slide around while I'm typing on it. A rubber back would prevent the sliding around and would look just fine on a phone build for durability.The phone is heavy. Know this going into it. It took my wrist a few days to get used to. Also, while the screen is 4.7"", the sheer size of the durable casing makes the phone about an inch bigger so while the screen is 4.7"" what you'll be carrying around in your pocket is something closer to a 6"" phone.The plugs are not ideal and are taking getting used to. Both the charger plug and the earphone plug are buried deep within the casing. This means jacks for both need to be extra long. If you've got any standard charger cords laying around the house that you were planning to use for this phone just plan on cutting away some of the casing to get it to fit. With headphones, you either need a skinny extender to make it work or stick with the super cheap headphones that have no buildup around the piece that goes in the phone. Also, I unscrewed the flaps that cover these two ports the day it arrived and haven't put them back on since. The phone isn't waterproof without these flaps on. Only one screw for each of these flaps so I still need to put them back on and see if they'll open from one side with the screw in. I hope they do otherwise you'll need to plan in advance for times you need this phone to be waterproof. I'll update this review after I've done this.Color. I ordered yellow but wasn't sure which I'd get because there seemed to be two colors (metally-sunshine-yellow and gold-yellow) in different pictures around the internet. I was good with either so figured it'd be a surprise upon arrive. However, it was neither of these yellows and instead was a type of caution-yellow (that's the best description I can give). The colored part of the phone is plastic too, while the pictures make it look like it's possibly metal. I'm fine with the plastic, just letting people know in case they assumed like I did.Screen brightness. The dimmest setting is still really bright, particularly at night in low light settings. I'd prefer dimmer but most people don't even adjust these settings.Speaker is loud. I can set it down and move about the room while listening to an audio book without issue. Also loud for music. For sound-quality-enthusiasts, you should already know some of the quality is lost when listening from a phone but most people aren't that discretionary on this anyway. It suits my purpose and I simply plug it into a sound system if I'm looking for high volume and quality sound.I'm being critical with my thoughts above simply because I think this information is nice to know. However, all in all, I'm VERY happy with this phone. Great price point with all the basics that I wanted. Fast phone, great battery life, decent camera.","0","Unhelpful"

"Huawei Ascend G300 Unlocked Phone - U.S. Warranty (Silver)","Huawei","206.94","1","I always like to give a product some time before I write a review on it. It's been 8 months since I bought this phone. I hate it. The power button works only sometimes. So, there will be times when you can't turn on the phone and cannot make a phone call. If you are in an emergency, you won't be able to reach anyone and you may die because of that. The phone, when it can be turned on, takes FOREVER to load a webpage. The touch screen is not sensitive. The battery needs to be recharged every day even if you don't use the phone. You will have many dropped calls. When the phone thinks you have talked enough, it will cut off your conversation and you have to call again to continue your conversation. Language input methods includes only English and Spanish. The picture of the phone on Amazon doesn't show the back of the phone. I thought it was all silver, but the back of the phone is white. The earphones broke within a week.

However, the headphone connection never worked well and was so bad that I never used it to listen to music or anything else by headphone. Secondly, despite trying various storage cards, the phone would never read them and thus kept me from utilizing more space than the basic GB that came with the phone. Finally, about one year in, it just refused to add new apps altogether, even if I deleted several to make space. This was a hassle when wifi connections required an app as part of the connection process, as is done at my university. Thus, I never got any apps that came out after 2014 and also never had wifi on campus, which was a major downfall. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, it was a real challenge to get the right phone accessories here in the US--it took at least 6 weeks being delivered from Asia which was a vulnerable time for the unprotected phone","0","Unhelpful"

"LG Electronics V20 - Factory Unlocked Phone - Titan Grey (U.S. Warranty)","","799.99","1","I am horribly displeased with this phone. I have had an LG G3 for years that I love. When this phone came out, I thought that it might be time for an upgrade. That was a horrible mistake! This phone is crap, and I will be returning it shortly. First problem is the battery only lasts a couple hours before I need to recharge it. Maybe that would be understandable if I was actively using a bunch of intensive applications, but this is with all the apps stopped except Audible and the screen turned off. I went into the settings and made sure no other apps were running in the background. Playing an audio file should not be burning through battery like that. Oh, speaking of burning, this thing gets HOT! Once again, with nothing but an audio file playing, this thing gets so hot that I can't keep it in my pocket without it burning my leg! No joke, this thing left a phone shaped, bright red burn on my thigh after having it in my pocket for a couple hours. I don't know if mine has a defect or what is causing this thing to get so hot or use battery so fast, but as it stands, this thing is useless. I am returning this P.O.S. and going back to my old phone.","0","Unhelpful"

"Huawei Honor 5X 16 GB Unlocked Phone with Huawei Stainless Steel Watch, Black","","459.98","5","I bought this phone back in October to replace my HTC One M9. The battery was failing on it and was draining from 100 all the way to zero within 6 hours even while in airplane mode and wifi turned off and with minimal usage. I went to get a new phone from ATT via the upgrade options only to discover I couldn't upgrade until April of next year. And so I went to Amazon, and decided I wanted a an unlocked phone with dual sim card slots as well as an sd card slot that was fast, with a good camera, and had a decent amount of onboard storage. That's when I found the Honor 5X from Huawei, a company I'd never heard of before. It had the specs of a flagship phone at half half the price of one and just $200. I was very sceptical at first, but with the money I had there weren't any other phones in the price range I could afford that I liked. I took the chance and ordered it, and fell in love with it as soon as I turned it on. It is everything it was advertised to be. The one and only gripe I have with it is it only has 2GB or RAM (I would have preferred 3GB or more), but even with this little RAM, the phone is fast enough for me, and so I can live with it.

"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black","BLU","292.99","3","I bought this phone for my wife because she was wanting a phablet and her neice has the BLUE STUDIO 5.0 and has been very happy with it.HOWEVER, my wife has used the phone for about a month and there are some things that have been annoying to her. For example: there are times when a call will come in and she swipes to answer and the call ends. Other times the phone will ring for a 5 or 10 seconds and then the call ends. (This happens often enough not to be a case of someone changing their mind and hanging up. And it happens very rarely on my phone). Sometimes the phone will start scrolling uncontrollablly. I think that these issues may be due to the STUDIO 6.0 LTE being a new phone and given a year or so to get the final bugs worked out, it could be a great phone.","0","Unhelpful"

"Nokia 5230 Quad-band GSM Cell Phone - Unlocked","Nokia","189","2","I bought this phone here because at the time it was $30 cheaper than what T-Mobile wanted non-contract. When I got it, I put my SIM card in. Calling worked fine, but I couldn't get the data service to work. After talking to many different people at T-Mobile (with several different answers), I concluded that the right answer was that the unlocked phone wasn't allowed by the network to use the data services (at least not 3G services). Thankfully Amazon allowed me to return this phone and T-Mobile was willing to cut their price some since I had to buy it from them and wasn't happy about it.Regarding the phone itself, it's a decent inexpensive smart phone. I still use it today (nearly a year later). The screen is small compared to more expensive phones. The touch screen actions are at times inconsistent (but you learn how to use it). It manages my gmail accounts nicely (though it can only be set to auto retrieve at most 2 accounts). You can do basic web browsing to get information you need. You wouldn't want to use it all the time or you would go insane due to the small screen. Speed is okay with 3G, painful with Edge (roughly equal to dial up). But the basic browsing capability has come in handy several times. Also, the remote lock and wipe features are nice ever needed.The biggest drawback is the Symbian OS. Everyone has pronounced it dead and it's tough to find apps for it. Tons of iPhone and Android apps out there do not and never will have a Symbian equivalent. If there were, I would use my phone more. As it is, I use an iPod touch wherever I can get wifi and only use my phone when I can't use the iPod.To be sure it's no iPhone, but it gets the job done - if you buy it from T-Mobile.","0","Unhelpful"

"BLU Advance 4.0- Includes One Month Free Service with Simple Mobile - Unlimited Talk and Text with 1GB of 4G Data ($40 value)-Black","BLU","75","2","I bought this phone in May, and it has completely stopped functioning in December.This phone was mainly used to take/receive calls and texts, and watch videos. There were no more than 10 apps downloaded to the phone. I realized that the apps start crashing in November, but I was still able to use the phone after closing all the apps or restarting the phone. And today this phone is completely dead. I tried charging the phone, taking the battery out and put it back, and leaving it untouched for hours etc, but the phone could not be turned on, and there were no flashing lights (like those red/green lights when charging) signaling that the phone's still ""alive"".However, despite being broken in less than 8 months, it is still an relatively good phone considering the price. It's good for simple tasks like calling and texting, receiving emails, surfing the internet, and google maps etc. Obviously you can't compare the touchscreen sensitivity to iPhones or Samsung phones, but if you don't rely on smartphones for doing everything, this is still a pretty good model to use.Another slight problem with this phone is the lack of diversity language keyboard input. If I'm not mistaken, I believe this phone can only type (and be able to receive texts) in certain western languages, for example English and Spanish but not Chinese or Korean.","0","Unhelpful"

Because after having a pin on it, for only 2 days, the same pin I use for something else, it kept giving me an error message telling me the pin was wrong. I could not open it to make a call or use the reset to factory default option. I restarted it, took off the battery, removed the sim, waited a few minutes, put everything back in, and that didn't solve the problem. I don't think in my opinion, that it is worth paying $80 for. You can get a much nicer, quality phone for that price or a little more. Also, the customer service for CellAllure is beyond awful. I had called them once, after spending quit a bit of time just trying to find their contact info online. The woman I reached had a thick accent, and we got disconnected, she had my number, but never called me back, even after she said she would. I even gave her my husband's number to use as back up. Then I emailed them about one issue, giving detailed info, and after 3 days, I finally receive a reply, that only said, ""Where did you buy the phone?"". Really? Also I called my children twice from the hospital, to let them know when I would be home, I left this phone with them, they said it never rang, and when I tried to send a pic attachment by text, it just sat in the box, never connected to my home wifi, although I have never had this issue with other phones I've used. Besides all that, the poor cust serv. is enough to suggest you steer clear of this brand. Would not recommend.","0","Unhelpful"

On standby it would last around 8 hours. so if you're a heavy phone user you'd probably have to charge it at least twice a day.- Very slow charge! It take almost as long to charge the battery as it does to drain it.- Dead after only ten months of moderate use.- the micro USB connector on the phone is also rather fickle, I often have to wrap the cable around the phone during charging.conclusion:If HTC refuses to stand behind THIS product I would conclude that buying any of their products is a risky proposition.BUYER BEWARE!!!","0","Unhelpful"

A few years ago, in China, I bought a real Samsung Note2 for a good price and had no trouble registering it with Samsung.I do not appreciate getting instructions in Chinese. In my experience, phones made to sell in China are not up to the standards of phones made to sell in the US.This company should be honest about what they are selling and not dress it up as ""an international version"" without a warranty.","0","Unhelpful"

I also had to get another sim card, because of the one i already had for a different phone will not activate correctly for this phone. best to go to an AT&T store so they can configure this for you. Also i love the phone's long battery life, and voice command feature. very fast and reliable. I purchased mine used so it did have some scratches on the device. So if you'd like a nice stylish phone but not too big on social networks or media, then this phone is for you. i have given up my IPhone 5, and started using this phone. Another thing i would like to add is to download the Nokia sync software offline for this device, so you can backup and update the phones software.I love this phone and keep in mind if you buy it used then it may not be perfect. IF the phone restarts when you put the sim card in, please replace the sim card because the configuration for the sim card and this phone will fail. also the phone does not have the Front-Facing camera like the e71, but it does have flash. Also the headphone jack is a 2.5 inch instead of the standard 3.5 inch like apple headphones, you will need and adapter, or Bluetooth headphones. The phone fits perfectly in my hand, and it has also taken me a while to get use to the keyboard feel, and the screen lock junction. Overall i highly love this phone","0","Unhelpful"

(Model#: L520 GOLD)","Posh Mobile","88","1","I spent 14 hours of my life fiddling with this phone that I will never get back. The problems are almost too numerous to mention. I started having my doubts about the phone when I went to the ""About Phone"" section and the text was overlaid with horizontal black stripes. At that point, I wondered if it was too late for me to buy the extended warranty for the phone. However I was still willing to give it a chance. As I started loading apps onto the phone, the phone would freeze and I would have to rebootit. Of note, was Facebook. I could never get that app to work. There were times when the phone screen would be totally black and did not respond to a reboot. After several minutes, I could usually turn the phone completely off with a hard reset and then turn it on again. I am not sure whether the person who tested the phone when requested, tried to load apps onto the phone. When it was first turned on, it seems to work fine. However, not being able to add apps, to have the phone freeze up, the screen turn black and not respond to a reboot was too much for me to handle. As I said, I gave up 14 hours of my life to this phone and I will never get them back. I return the phone the next day. I am very thankful for Amazon's return policy.","0","Unhelpful"

Camera is pretty decent, although night pictures could be better, wifi really doesn't take much juice, but guys from tech support are useless (at least t-mobile staff), so you will need to google internet settings yourself. Although I couldn't find how to use camera (neither back camera, nor front)with Skype. Skype itself works fine. Any way I think, I even didn't use all features of the phone. And it's small. Small, and solid. Couple years ago I bought it brand new for about 170 or 180 bucks, so it totally worth the money.

However this phone is different-it takes great photos! It fits comfortably in my hand, and although I'm concerned with only having 8 gbs of storage on the device-I know an ad card will be a great place for photos, videos and music. The screen is super bright, however the device does feel cheep in the hand. What can you expect for the price though. If you would rather have a better build quality then epic camera quality you need to go with the kata i3s-it's built better then many flagship smartphones, and although it's advertised as 3G speed it gets the same h+ this phone gets.The camera on this phone-although not iPhone good, is still pretty epic.

My own experience with the phone has been great as well. Until it broke down. The phone just died and won't turn on anymore. When connected to charger the light and screen backlight come on for a few seconds then turn back off. I am sending it for repairs - will see if Nokia honors the warranty Amazon promised. By the way it looks like I am not the only one having this problem - just google for ""E51 won't turn on""There are a few other negative things I have (or had - while it worked) to say about E51 in no particular order. First if you need input for non-latin languages, that is not going to be easy because apparently it requires re-flashing the device creatively with localized (for the country where the language is used) version of Symbian - which obviously voids the US warranty and too much of a hassle.Second, as somebody noticed, the dust accumulates behind the screen quickly and I see no way to remove it.Third, custom voice recognition is not supported - so you can not train the phone to recognize your voice (or language) for voice dialing. You have to pronounce names of your contacts with English accent or they won't be recognized. This is ridiculous - even my old 6230 allows me to assign any voice tags I want.Fourth, the camera produces pictures with annoying green tint which makes it almost unusable. There is no tint in ""night mode"" but then you loose quality. This problem has been discussed in various forums many times with hope that the ""next"" software release would fix it. Which obviously hasn't happen in a couple of years the phone has been on the market.","0","Unhelpful"

I gave it four stars because it is cheap, and for what you get its a pretty god price.","0","Unhelpful"
"Unlocked Huawei Honor X2 16GB 7.0 inch TFT LTPS Capacitive Screen Android OS 5.0 Phablet Smart Phone, Hisilicon Kirin 930 Octa Core 2.0GHz, RAM: 3GB,GSM & WCDMA Silver (Standard)","Huawei","223.99","5","I'll update this post with more details but I wanted to sum up this phone. It's a great performing phone, a decent camera, and runs android 6.0 after the updates. Smooth action and fast! It is an ideal phone for an experienced android user. If you can handle a couple technical steps the phone does not come fully set up for google! The seller put Google Play store on it but I reset the phone with factory reset and started from scratch.The Huawei apps are all in Chinese. I deleted what I could and the rest I dragged them on top of each other so that they contain themselves in a single folder that I can put out of the way. No time for Chinese here. Using HUAWEI's app program I searched just for GOOGLE until it found Google Play and I installed this from the Chinese App installer (a chinese play store). (that I later hid). Once google play was in place it's a matter of grabbing the google apps you need including google Chrome, MAPS, and Google Voice Search. Install these. Then using chrome, search for Google Contacts for Huawei and youll find on the internet Google Contacts sync which will be a APK file. This you install and accept the install and run it. THis will connect GOOGLE contacts to the Huawei dialer and this this phone becomes Apple Pie American! But better than anything you can buy for $200 bucks in real phone cost. With it's 8 core processor and 3 gb ram, It feels as good as anything Apple or Samsung can put out!When the phone goes to sleep, when you first wake it there's some Chinese gibberish at the bottom but I just ignore it. The rest of the chinese is gone.I will when I get the guts attempt to root the phone! Eventually when and if it come available, I'll install a custom rom and get rid of every hint of the original chinese version. For the money I paid, I'm thrilled. it's the best phone I've owned and the size is perfect.. it fits in your hand and it makes people go yum yum yum.I've been looking at this phone for 6 months now. My only regret is I didn't spring for it 6 months ago. Shipping from Hong Kong was faster than many items I order off Amazon! The shipper did a great job!","0","Unhelpful"

Also the Internet consistently Shuts off and takes 5 minutes to finally find a wifi network. It also restarts randomly and gets stuck on the android logo. I check more info on the phone and it has 3 processors and 2 of them stop working when you don't use your phone which is concerning. I want a full refund, I can't believe it...

"BlackBerry Passport SQW100-4 Silver Edition Unlocked 32GB International Stock No Warranty - Silver","BlackBerry","248.65","5","I'm surprised by how much I like this phone. The team that put this phone together may never give a TED talk on creativity or be featured on the cover of Wired, but they really hit a home-run with this phone. Rather than repeating what's been said before, let me focus on audio. If you want a phone that plays 24bit audio files, or 16 bit lossless flacs, look no further. I own a PONO, and think this Blackberry is nearly as good. You get much better battery life than the PONO. The noise floor is really low and the staging of instruments is excellent. The built-in stereo speakers are better than my macbook laptop speakers - bass aside most music is quite enjoyable without headphones. I mean you could buy this just as a high-def music player and never get a phone plan for it and it would be an excellent purchase.So far all android apps I've downloaded are working perfectly. As are the BB apps. The ability to read/write/and create Word and Excel files is a surprise bonus I wasn't expecting but very much appreciate. And this is the first time I've ever enjoyed reading a book on a phone. It has been a few days since I bought the phone and I haven't even hooked it up the my cellular provider - yet I'm using it all day to surf the web, listen to hi-def music, and read books. Will update the review once I start using it as a phone.Don't miss out on this. You get the flagship phone experience for $200. Audiophiles take note before buying a high-end player. Buy this as a stand-alone music server.","0","Unhelpful"

I presumed that phone functioned as stated, i.e. the phone would be unlocked. In August 2016, I tried to get the phone to work but the phone was locked and therefore inoperable for me. I contacted BREED and their customer service was responsive in a timely manner. BREEDΓÇÖs customer service apologized for the inconvenience and said they would work with the manufacturer to get the phoneΓÇÖs unlock code. BREED later responded that there is no way to get the unlock code due to the length of time passed since it was ordered.

"Blu LIFE 8 Unlocked (Orange)","BLU","169.99","3","It is in no fashion a bad phone. I've owned a BLU phone prior to this and moved to this phone because of it's additional cores and higher resolution camera in comparison to the old phone.Pros: Good Screen - it's not going to blow your mind or anything but it's a solid screen.The Look- I like the look of it. I feel it's very sleek.Cons:The Home Bar - It's moody. After three months I still cannot determine if the home bar needs an aggressive knuckle bending poke or the daintiest of taps. Additionally the home bar is back-lit and while that is very neat looking it's also deeply impractical when combined with a moody home bar because the icons completely disappear.The Bumper Case - The case itself is fine. I received a frosted white case which made the phone look filthy the instant it was applied. I don't use this case, I hated my phone looking dirty and it kinda ruined the shape and feel of the phone for me.Weird Behavior ΓÇô If the battery gets low enough that the phone legitimately dies it might not turn back on shortly after being connected to a power source. Or within the hour. I've experienced this three times as of now.This phone is perfectly fine but I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this specific model. It looks nice and functions well but the home bar issue is annoying enough for me to miss my old BLU phone. I still think BLU is a good company and are capable of producing a great product but this one was a bit off.","0","Unhelpful"

It booted rather quickly and I signed into Google. I was able to sync all of my apps which was a major plus as this can be a pain. The screen is very bright and the pictures seem very crisp. It lagged a bit the more apps that DL and with only 15 of my fav apps from my previous 200 and something in my old phone, it said I went from 16GB to 9...again my old phone had over 200 and barely used 4 so I'm not sure how this is.....when I attempted to organize my apps, all of a sudden the phone blitzed and apps went all over..not a fan of it just simply restarting or changing what I had already done...the case is not something that will protect it, clear flimsy plastic.All in all the phone(at this stage) day 1, is about a 3. I haven't inserted a sim yet and were still don't debating even using it. It might be a useful kids phone or older person..but for someone who does business, personal and school, this phone would never cut it....","0","Unhelpful"

However, the emergency dial feature has now gotten me into trouble. Even when the keypad is locked, if you (or something in your pocket) presses 0, it will go to the emergency dialer. Since the 0 key is at the bottom of the phone, and sticks out of the rounded design, it's very easy to end up dialing 911 without realizing. My new verdict is that this is not only hard-to-use, but garbage all around.","0","Unhelpful"

I received the phone and it comes with a mix-match of equipment.-Phone (which needs to have the sticker peeled off the back before use)-headphones (TERRIBLE! i mean airlines give out better ones. they should just not include it. it was horrendous and it hurt my ear.)-charger and short cord which didnt even match in color but it worked.-clear flexible plastic cover-screeen protector not tempered1. the phone itself is big. not tablet huge but still challenging to text with one hand big. screen is big and the picture isnt bad so ill give it 4 stars there.2. the microphone is terrible. i am overseas serving and thought i could use this phone but NO WAY. the speaker is terrible and it makes people sound like they are talking through a mesh screen. 0 stars but im overseas so i cant do anything about it :(3. i cant have a conversation on this phone. enough said.4. memory is 8gb and cannot be expanded to 16gb. i have not tried other sizes but definitely NOT 16gb.so i ask again what do you need it for? if it is for surfing the web (WITHOUT AUDIO) great!if you want to play games, listen to youtube, have a conversation go and buy something else.","0","Unhelpful"

I've always admire Sony's phones, but was disappointed they never made it to Big Red (Verizon) or Ma Bell aka Big Blue (AT&T). When my PRIV's screen cracked I decided to order a budget android. Long story short I couldn't do it and decide to see what a fairly recent Xperia would cost. MONEY WELL SPENT! I love this phone, and the fact it's unlocked is even better! No more waiting on AT&T to put their touches on an update before pushing it. This phone is beautiful...the prettiest phone I've ever owned (and I've owned alot (but never iPhones)). It's performance, so far has been on point, screen is very nice, camera is great, no heating on the back experienced after heavy usage and doing all the updates. I was able to delete/disable most of the pre-installed apps. Everyone knows Sony puts out quality and cutting edge products that are harmonious with it's Japanese roots. Unless they do something disappointing, they got a new life long Xperia phone user.","0","Unhelpful"

I was starting to wondering why I have never received a call. So I called my cell from my home phone and needless to say my new cell phone, Verykool, would not ring. I called my son and put the phone on speaker and i could not hear him and he could not hear me. So I tapped the phone where the speaker is and I got intermittent sound and then no sound at all. Well needless to say after I found all this out it was to late to return the item and I am very disappointed. Buyer please be ware of possible speaker issues. Don't waste your money.","0","Unhelpful"

I decided to go with this because I thought it would be nice to support a smaller American company. I guess that was a mistake! Up until recently the phone performed well. Excellent features including a great screen and camera. I would have rated this 5 stars. However a couple weeks ago it became difficult to get it to charge. After trying a new cable I discovered the problem was a loose charging port. Now the phone won't charge at all. So nothing I can do now as I'm well past the return window. I know you can't expect a long life from a cell phone, but I expected more than 7 months! I guess I should have opted for the bigger brand name foreign company.","0","Unhelpful"

I've had it close to a month almost, and I haven't encountered any technical issues. It was really easy to set up & the use of my Scard with Tmobile, there was no interruption of service or features.The only complaint I have is that I bought the gold phone. But a week after I got it, I noticed that on the back of the phone, right above the BLU initials & below them; there seemed to be a change of color from gold to like a dark bronze tarnish. It looks like two distinct lines above and below. You can see it really well. At first I thought it was something on it and I tried to wipe it off, but it wouldn't come off. So it's definitely something to do with the way the phone/color was made for the back of the phone. Kinda a bummer but not a huge issue. Just hope it doesn't continue.","0","Unhelpful"

There is a drop-down alphabet, in case you'd like a shortcut on your way to ""Mom"", but the font is so miniature that it's a useless feature. How would you select M if you (1) can't see it, or if you (2) need a magnifying glass and a needle-sized stylus to select it? How does ridiculous stuff like this pass the design process?

Now it functions as well as it should and I haven't replaced it yet. I saw a review, I don't remember where, that said the OS can upgrade. The Android (4.2.2) does not have an upgrade I can find.

I am not a phone person, and use this as a prepaid phone for emergencies, to carry in my bag. it is tiny and can fit in small change purse. The prior Cingular version I had had capabilities for emailing, texting and internet but stopped working when AT&T took over. This newer AT&T program is supposed to do the same and has options for it, but I can't get internet service, though I haven't checked it out yet at an AT&T store. No matter. Would rather not use my prepaid minutes on the internet anyway. Maybe it needs a newer program. Has a camera but don't know if is good quality. I am still getting used to the new program.This phone serves it purpose. Definitely depends on what you want it for.

"BLU WIN JR - 4.0"" Windows Smartphone - Global GSM Unlocked - White","BLU","59.99","4","Ok first - the phone works amazingly well. Very quick and fairly easy to figure out (everything is there - it is just set up slightly differently than what I was used to from an android phone).However and just so you know - (I didn't realize this until afterwards) this is a Windows phone, which means you will only be able to use Windows apps on it. I'm sure lots of people know this by now, but I'm in my mid-40's and kind of out of the loop when it comes to this.So I purchased an sd-card with my old android, and saved all of the apps I liked to install on the windows blu phone, but none of them would transfer over. I was able to find some of them in the Windows store, but sadly not all.I was able to transfer my pictures and videos thankfully.Also, you need a SIM card with this from whichever phone company you use. I am with Net10 and had to get them to send a SIM card to me (one for 99 cents), which they did and everything went fine, which was a little shocking in itself.If it weren't for that, I would give it 5 stars because it really does work fantastic, and you can't beat the price. I took away one star for my own ignorance, I suppose - but they need to put that info out there for those of us who don't really know what's going on!So in all - nice screen size, nice video resolution, front and rear cameras, and even comes with a couple of screen protectors, a basic case and blu-tooth headphones that I don't know how to use but may go read the book at some point. Much, much nicer than I was expecting for less than $40, that's for sure.","0","Unhelpful"

I bought it because i needed to replace a HTC Evo that had shattered. I wanted the unlocked global gsm sim slot (though you cannot use it on a US GSM network w/o spring unlocking it).There are a few issues with the phone though:- The pentile display is visibly pixelated (for me).- SD card mounting is unusual, most internal memory is mounted where android apps expect the SD card to be. This matters because your music ends up on internal memory, not external if you're using google play.- Ice Cream Sandwich will not be released till Q4 2012 at earliest. This is extremely annoying and one of the most frustrating things about android devices when compared with Apple.","0","Unhelpful"
"Motorola Moto G (3rd Generation) - Black - 16 GB - Global GSM Unlocked Phone","Motorola","144.99","4","Overall, a good budget buy. Lost my Moto G first gen and replaced it with an ASUS Zen of which battery life was a disaster, so I went back to Motorola. For the first few months the Moto G3 was perfect, minus the lack of pulsing light notification (seriously Motorola?). However since the upgrade to Marshmallow, the system became incredibly slow sometimes, which forces me to restart the phone every week or so. This seems to work fine. Overall, not bad for web browsing, but with apps that are heavier on RAM like navigation or image processing, you will notice the lag.Overall, still pretty good, but I definitely miss the pulsing notification light, and terribly slow sometimes after upgrading to Android 6. Will probably look to replace it next time, as apps like Maps or (Facebook) Messenger can be unbearably slow. Wish every mobile device works as well as my Nexus 7, still the best small tablet ever that works like a charm after 3 years.","0","Unhelpful"

I don't use the phone for work, am not on social media 24/7, don't play video or games on it so can't judge on the storage or how fast it is compared to a higher-end phone, but it has all the functions I need--I have enough room for all the apps I use, can sync everything to Google so my photos and contacts and everything get backed up elsewhere, can use GPS, make calls and store numbers, etc. I took it to England and it worked fine. The only downside I'd say is that the plastic case is a bit soft; I've dropped it a few times and have scraped the cover, so I'll need to buy a protective cover.

All of the functions are not going to work with the Iphone, but this is in the description of the product. I finally discovered that the only way to sync the phone and watch was to bluetooth them together. You cannot use the watch sync available on Apple products. The instruction pamphlet is in English but the print is so small it is impossible to read if your eyesight is less than perfect without a magnifying glass. The battery lasted 2 1/2 days being constantly synced to my phone and I ran the sleep monitor app all night both nights. The watch recharges quickly and there are several useful apps on the watch itself. I have to recommend this watch, but be prepared to have to figure out how to use it on your own.

"Moto G (4th Generation) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads","Motorola","199.99","4","This phone is, as many others have already said, a good value for the money. It offers rock-solid Bluetooth, good apps, and is an excellent telephone as well. The advertising annoys me quite a bit although one does get used to that in time. The ubiquitous ads are why I rated it only 4 stars. There are so many ads popping up everywhere these days, not just on smartphones, that it's hard to tell which are the Amazon directed ads or which are Android or Google ads. Next time I'll pay the extra bucks to get a cleaner interface.The other reason I wrote this review is to explain an issue I had and how I resolved it. My wifi connection began experiencing problems after the last big s/w upgrade a month or two ago (Android Marshmallow 6.0.1) the phone would experience problems seeing the Internet signal from my wifi router located only inches away. The wifi was still connected to the G4 and other phones and laptops had no problem, but the G4 was offline. At this time it would report, ""connected, no Internet"". Rebooting seemed to help occasionally as did powering off and on but neither solution worked reliably. After a time, the Internet would magically reappear.I tried many fixes but what finally worked was to clear the reminder banners that are always present on the opening screen. These banners consist of ads, nags from email or other apps wanting your attention, system notices and similar. If you fiddle with the scrolling of that message cluster several little rectangles will appear at its bottom right. Touching these bars instantly clears the ads. I discovered this quite by accident and ever since then I've been clearing those reminders after opening the phone. I've never again lost the Internet. Once it connects to a router, it stays connected.Hopefully, this will help others who might be experiencing ""wifi"" problems with their G4","0","Unhelpful"

"ZTE Axon 7 unlocked smartphone,64GB Grey (US Warranty)","ZTE","399.99","4","Surprisingly great phone. Excellent quality materials, feels very sold all metal design. Screen is on par with Samsung S7 Edge (also own) the text is very sharp and easy to read. The phone is very fast, esp with a new Launcher installed. Interestingly, my ATT Sim card gets stronger 4G LTE service than my S7 Edge! The UI works well, and the Quick Charge 3.0 is very fast.The BEST feature? The amazing, you won't believe it sound quality!! OMG what a shock compared to the S7 Edge. No contest, the ZTE is absolutely king! From Netflix, to headphones to BT in the car the stellar Dolby Sound quality is a huge feature.The rear fingerprint scanner is awesome. So nice not to have to hold the phone in my left hand, then place my right finger on the front button!The screen is nearly 100% of the front of the device so the body is smaller than smaller screen phones, definitely the future. Samsung needs to get it together (and Apple) and reduce those huge top/bttm bezels!!The packaging is also very high end with a nice clear case (no need to order one), USB C/adapter, Screen Protector, and very nice ear buds with metal materials. Very nicely done and the price is great. I was skeptical to buy it, but now that I have been using it and switching between Galaxy S7 Edge and the ZTE, I really like the ZTE.The only complaints are:No wireless charging, not a huge deal really because the S& Edge is so finicky about placement on its charger anywayScreen while really amazing, isnt quite as bright as the S7 Edge even though both are Super Amoled and same resolution/DPI.","0","Unhelpful"

"Silver Smartphone Mtk6572a/x 1.0g Dual Core Android 4.4 Dual SIM 4.0 Inch 480*800 LCD Screen No-contract Mobile Phone","Generic","NA","3","This is a BASIC cheap phone which is great for international roaming use. I purchased it for use on a trip in Europe for 2 weeks, and then activated it with T-Mobile (U.S.) service on their standard plan (no contract), which now has free international texting and international data roaming, and then left my usual Sprint phone at home, plugged in, with a text-forwarding app activated. This worked pretty well. The drawbacks to this phone are that it has a very slow / cheap processor, so there was A LOT of lag time when trying to do basic tasks with the phone (e.g. use an app, navigate with Google Maps). There is also VERY limited storage, but the version of Android it is loaded with does allow for apps to be moved to the SD card, so that helps a little bit. If I were to do this kind of thing again, I would probably get an updated version of this phone, which I believe has a faster processor. One drawback to this phone (which shouldn't be surprising given the low price) is that any time you launch the standard web-browser, it would re-direct to a few other webpages, a la a spyware kind of thing. I'm sure the cheap Chinese manufacturer had some sort of built in code to do this - I couldn't figure out a way to make it stop doing that, and it did that from the very beginning, so it's not like I had downloaded some sort of malware thing by mistake. Be aware too, that this phone was really only okay for the most BASIC tasks, like navigating with Google Maps, which still would just quit after awhile (if it got tired). Also, if activating on T-Mobile service, know that the download speed is always 2G (VERY slow), unless you buy a faster speed in a ""pack."" The positive thing is that it is Quad-Band, so it covers all the wireless spectrum that the various European countries use - there was never a time that it didn't work in the countries we were in (Portugal, Switzerland, France, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands). The other (slightly) annoying thing is that with T-Mobile roaming, it would sometimes switch back and forth between a European network (which would stink if one particular network was better than another), even if just traveling slightly, but that wasn't the phone's fault.","0","Unhelpful"

"NUU Mobile N4L 5.0"" HD Dual LTE SIM Android Lollipop Smartphone with 2YR Warranty, Black","Nuu Mobile","99.99","2","The good. It's inexpensive, much faster than older phone, and does jump between GSM/CDMA networks so you get signal in a lot of places. New enough OS, and GPS so you can play Pokemon GO. Looks like FM radio is already unlocked, and minimal bloatware on the phone which I found utterly surprising due to the cost. Dual SIM slots, and took a 32GB SD card just fine.The bad. It only has GPS, no compass, no gyroscope, none of the usual bells and whistles you find for things like that. As such, no map will ever change bearing to match which direction the phone is facing, and AR mode does not work in any game, including Pokemon GO. The GPS is also very weak, so tracking position is rather poor with even minimal cover. The chipset offers compass and gyroscope, but the developers haven't enabled it. There are a lot of features the chipset offers but not enabled by the phone developers. Additionally, there is absolutely no custom ROM for this phone to be found on the internet. The phone dialer app often suffered from a bug disallowing calls out, easily remedied using the hangouts dialer app. The price is low probably because they didn't pay developers to write out everything needed to fully utilize the features available on the hardware.The ugly. Also, I'm exchanging it with package sitting on counter as I type this. There was a system update last night, which failed and bricked the phone. Was able to access recovery menu, backed up user data to an SD card, and factory reset was not able to restore the phone to working order. Unfortunately, no one had a flash available to attempt the restore process, and because it was purchased through amazon.com and not nuumobile.com I was told tech support was unavailable and that the warranty is whatever the return policy is through Amazon. If there's a 2 year warranty as in title description, then it's something Amazon offers, and I'm finding no record of it. Luckily, it bricked in the first 30 days, so I'm in the refund/exchange period. The 2 year warranty, per nuumobile tech support, only applies if the phone is purchased on nuumobile.com.Giving 2 stars since when it's working, it's ok, if lackluster in utilizing it's capabilities. If the replacement pans out, I'll probably use it for a few months, then it's going to end up a hand me down to my nieces.","0","Unhelpful"

"HTC myTouch 3G Unlocked Android Phone with 3G Support, GPS, and Touch Screen - US Warranty - White","HTC","18.88","2","The phone came in a plain generic white box (not HTC genuine box) which indicates that the phone is a reject (returned open box or refurbished). I made a mistake of not returning the phone within the return window. Now, just few months later, the phone freezes and does not work most of the time. I am going to throw it in the garbage and buy another phone from a different manufacturer and a different seller. The seller was dishonest in not disclosing that the phone is a reject. If you want to buy it be careful whom you buy it from!This is probably a reflection on the particulare seller I purchased the phone from and not the phone itself because I bought another identical phone from another seller (it came in original HTC box) and that phone works just fineRegarding numerous comments many other reviewers wrote that the phone is locked to Tmobile, this is not entirely true. The phone does come with the Tmobile logo on it and initially tied to TMobile, but the phone can easily be switched to another GSM carrier: You can adjust the settings (there are instructions on how to do it including a videa posted online) or (much easier) you can initiate a connection to Google gmail account through TMobile. After this initial call, the phone becomes totally unlocked. If you are not currently a TMObile customer, you can probably borrow a TMobile SIM card from a friend for few minutes to initiate the first call, and then return the SIM card.In Summary, the phone is fine if you buy it from an honest seller who will send you a brand new phone in its original HTC packaging and not a reject in a generic white unmarked box!","0","Unhelpful"

However, just after leaving the return/replacement window it has gone to crap. Battery life is greatly reduced (have to charge twice a day), the phone freezes constantly - with all apps/widgets closed, and I had 1 day where my phone completely died - battery was at 95% and wouldn't turn back on until a day later.I have to switch back to my old, crappy phone (also a BLU but at least that one works) until I can afford to purchase a new phone that's not crap. My old phone's battery life is actually a little better than this one and I had been using that one for over a year and a half - I have owned this one for a little over 30 days.Oh and for an 8gb phone - it has crap for storage space. Even if you have plenty of space to do a download, it won't let you.","0","Unhelpful"

Everything was wrapped and unopened in its original packaging. The phone had two plastic protectors (one on its front and one on its back). I found that the phone had ZERO scratches or dents and looked unused whatsoever. If I am to nitpick, the only problem I would have is the box of the phone had a few specks of dirt on it :p. Everything about the package was great. The product was well protected with bubble wrap and foam pieces. The box was larger than needed but it was because of all the protection filled in it. I highly recommend this product, because the price was reasonable for something that was used only for a few minutes by the seller and looks brand new.","0","Unhelpful"
"Nokia Lumia 830 Orange Factory Unlocked GSM - International Version","","159.99","5","The shipment arrived in 3 weeks -- a week earlier than specified when i placed the order. It was packed well and looked authentic -- really brand new and not a pre-owned one. The battery was taped where it meets the contacts to prevent discharging prior to use. So one has to remove the small cellophane tape and the phone is good to go.I've had it for a little over a week on T-mobile. So far it looks to be in good order -- a great, sleek looking and feeling phone with a very fine finish. I've seen no problems in the display, speed or over heating. However, the battery consumption appears to be higher than I expected. I'm a light user of the phone, using it only for the occassional phone call -- one every 2 days, very rare texting of short 1 line messages, the HERE maps and email. Yet, it uses up 35% of the battery in a day! I can't tell that the display resolution is not high; i don't play games or watch streaming video. The response of the phone is fast and the touch quite sensitive. The Apps available are sufficient for my daily and projected use.So I'm so far happy with this phone. I hope I continue to remain so.","0","Unhelpful"

It has a mind of its own and takes pictures when it feels like, makes random phone calls when it feels like. I put up with it for a few months, then it told me that ""android contacts has stopped working"", at that point it wiped out all of my contacts and any pictures that were on the micro sd card. I switched it off and tried restarting, worked a couple of times, then it just sort of gave up and the screen just went dark and nothing was ever seen again. At this point I took out the SIM,sd card and the battery. Put the rest in the garbage where it belongs. Only good thing, possibly, is that if someone was going to mug you, you could probably use it as a defensive weapon. Otherwise not worth the frustration or your hard earned money.","0","Unhelpful"

It has two SIM slots so you can choose which account to send/call from. It differentiates between the accounts in your contact list by color and provides you the ability to set a default account but still operate from the other for individual actions if you would like. The one down side is it is not a smart phone so for a guy who is used to the 'swiping' function for texting on my Samsung, using this type of phone for texts is a bit of a drag--but that is not the phone's fault. The battery life is great on this--I only have to charge it about once a week (I am not on it much though--if I was calling or texting more that would probably not hold true). No games or other fun features, but if all you are looking for is a dual account phone, this is a great option--especially for the price. I have used it in Europe and in Africa.

"Star 4.5 US GSM (Black)","BLU","89.99","2","I bought this phone specifically to use while traveling in Europe. The first issue that I noticed was simply how slow the phone was....15-20 seconds to open most apps (Gmail, facebook, uber, google maps). The second issue was that I trusted a previous reviewer who stated they got 4G speeds in Europe. To be clear this phone does not have 4G/LTE capabilities. Only 3G speeds.I was able to successfully use this phone in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and Sweden. Due to the speed issues of loading apps and download speeds I primarily used this phone as a mobile hotspot using data-only sim cards purchased in each country. However battery life is quite poor...lasting less about ~4 hours when used as a mobile hotspot.Overall, if you're looking for a cheap phone to use while in Europe I'd suggest looking at a newer model. This clunky brick works more like a phone from 2006 than 2016 which ultimately just leaves you banging your head against a wall. I purchased this phone at around $80 USD. I would have been better served to 1. buy a more expensive GSM unlocked phone that works more like a 2016 smartphone should. Or 2. buy a GSM unlocked mobile hotspot and simply tether my US based phone in Europe.","0","Unhelpful"

Only thing is that as in the previous dual sim phone I had the screen sometimes freezes for several seconds randomly. I am starting to believe this is caused by having both sims on at the same time. I recommend this if you want to have a good samsung phone but need to have 2 sims and don't want to spend and arm and a leg on the premium phones.","0","Unhelpful"

"Samsung Galaxy J1 J100M Duos Latin Stock Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Black","Samsung","107.45","1","This phone does not perform well. I use it mostly in the US, but I've also used it in Thailand and Taiwan. The problems that occur in the US also occur in Thailand and Taiwan. The phone has 4 GB of memory, I added a 128 GB SIM card. Cons: Will not maintain a connection. Even when it has a 4G connection it does not an internet connection. It connects and disconnects at random. Frequently has difficulty switching between internet over the phone network and a local wi-fi. Very often no connection is available. Rebooting the phone will sometimes cause it to connect to the phone network or wi-fi. The phone becomes slow and rebooting will improve performance. With the stock apps that came with the phone, there isn't enough memory available. This results in some features not working. Viewing pictures for example. Cannot depend on using the call feature. Most of the time is shows ""Dialing"" but never calls a number. Pressing the End Call button does not end the ""Dialing"". The phone must be rebooted.Never got the dual SIM cards working. (Took the phone to 4 different shops.) Pros: Reboot time is very fast. (Given the frequency that rebooting is required, this is a good thing.) Picture quality if good. Works well as a hotspot (when it connects to the network). Video chat on Facebook is good. Assume the mic quality is good as it works well with voice recognition on Google translate.Do not rely on this phone for emergencies. Cannot recommend this phone.","0","Unhelpful"

The new android OS is fast and flawless, great pixel quality, and the phone seems very tough (I have NO case on the phone and I've dropped it multiple times throughout the year with no damage) The ONLY negative attribute of this phone is that it has no auto/spell correct for texting and if you need CDMA you are out of luck (GSM Only, but coverage where I live is just as good as CDMA).

This is not because of the main flaps, it was due to the poor design of the 1/8 jack port flap. If i had known how useless that flap would be and how not water proof the 1/8 jack is, i would have poured hot glue in it when i first got the phone, which is my recommendation if you intend to go swimming with this phone. Received water damage from that location, plugging in an 1/8 cable causes it to activate the buttons (power and volume).Also the touch screen is horrible, or the software for it does not work well, i think its due to the glove mode that they have, the sensitivity is very screwy. If your use to any smartphone like a note or galaxy s6active or iphone, you will notice a striking difference in the sensitivity and touch detection, it will bother you.The software is horrible, by that i mean the firmware.The pro of this phone, it is a tank, i've dropped it way over 10' and i just like to toss it around from time to time because i trust it not to break. It does great in the rain, in terms of surviving, and any normal stuff; except for when you forget the phone in your pocket and go into 4 foot deep water, and it just so happens the 1/8 jack comes slightly loose.","0","Unhelpful"

The phone is always telling me the phone will not work properly due to no space and to clean cach or delete apps and files, to increase storage.

I did a lot of research on this phone. I've heard many stories about the screen cracking and I've seen many reviews where the screen was torture tested and held up fine. My conclusion is that there are many fakes out there that are essentially exactly the same but with lower quality screens that shatter when dropped from above about 2 feet. Those are the ones sold by the other company something-Sky or whatever it's called. I'm almost certain these are the real ones. I waited a week and a half to write this review for that reason. I'm very tough on phones. I've already had this thing underwater, dropped it hard multiple times from roughly 3.5 ft on hard surfaces and there is not a scratch on it. I customize my phones to no end but the version of Android that came on this was the coolest stock phone setup I've seen yet. My last phone was an UMI eMax and even if this was not a rugged phone I would take the performance of this over the BLU. It's a 1 ghz processor but man does it make use of it. The battery life is phenomenal and this is already by far my favorite phone that I've bought. If you need a weatherproof phone that's fast and has the craziest battery life you've seen, buy this. Also, it shipped from China in 3 days, I was shocked.UPDATE:So the screen broke. It took a really hard fall on the edge and shattered badly. They are making replacement LCDs now, which are actually pretty cheap at $42. If the screens on the replacements are a little better I'll be satisfied with my purchase.","0","Unhelpful"

There isn't much difference in terms of the software. The camera, though it has the same MP, is a little better than the G2's in my opinion. It's running smooth so far - I am however worried because my G2 has 2GB RAM as well and it caused the phone to lag after about 5 months or so... I am pleased that I now have removable battery and expandable storage. The screen is such a beauty and the perfect size for me. I would recommend if you're interested in testing the LG waters or if you're looking to upgrade from a different brand. I wouldn't recommend and upgrade from a G2 because as I mentioned, there isn't much difference between the two. Oh let me add that the color (Red), is exactly as displayed in the pictures on here... my opinion it kinds looks purplish--- it's a very pretty color.","0","Unhelpful"

"Samsung Focus i917 (Unlocked)","Samsung","42.5","4","First off, I was at first gravely disappointed when I thought I couldn't add CUSTOM RINGTONES. Then I discovered how...To create a ringtone using the Zune software Open the Zune software and find the file you want to turn into a ringtone. Right-click the file, and then click Edit. In the GENRE list, click or type ringtone, then click OK. Connect your phone to your computer using a cable, and then sync the file to your phone. Now on your phone: On Start, flick left to the App list, then tap Settings > Ringtones + sounds. Tap the Ringtone list, then find the new ringtone you just added.That being said... It all seems pretty user friendly (except for the ringtones). It set up easily. I mainly bought it for texting and talking. For this, it works great.I haven't tried some other features because I don't have a data plan. For example, the internet seems fast, but I don't really use it even with wi-fi. The screen is too small for my preference. Maybe it wouldn't bother someone with younger eyes.The camera is nothing to brag about, but I didn't buy it for that. I would rather use my digital camera and get better photo quality than a phone camera can give anyway. I did, however, take some photos with the phone to use for my contacts' profile pictures. Worked well enough for that.The music option is easy peasy but you must use Zune (which I happen to have). Speaking of Zune... My computer won't recongnize the phone as a device except thru Zune. Again, awkward but still works for me. Could really prove a problem for someone who doesn't have that program.The Facebook connection option was CRAZY. All 500 of my ""friends"" info downloaded!!! Quickly resolved... I turned off that option.I know this isn't the latest technology so I wasn't expecting a ton of bells and whistles, but what bells and whistles that came with it, I'm happy with.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the funky camera and how obsolete they make it to select a custom ringtone.","0","Unhelpful"

When I dropped my phone in a [sugary] drink, I was afraid I had lost my Pearl forever. I didn't want a new phone because I loved my Pearl and I knew ATT wouldn't offer it anymore. So I began to search for a replacement 8110 online and of course it lead me to Amazon (they have everything!!). I knew that an ""unlocked"" phone was what I needed because I just drop my SIM in it from my old phone and I would be ready to go. The phone arrived faster than expected, and seemingly brand new.

"CUBOT BOBBY Smartphone Android 4.2 MTK6572W 1.3GHz 5.0 Inch QHD Screen - White","China","104.99","2","Well.... I loved this phone up until the camera broke on me... I mean. I would love to given this phone 5 stars but I can't, I just bought this phone 2 days ago...when ever I try to take a photo it force closes and says ""cannot open gallery"". I plan on demanding a replacement as soon as I can get to a desktop. Other than that the battery LSTs an amazing time. With moderate use it can last from 8am to 6pm or even longer if you aren't a constant texter or phone taker like I am the screen is long which is a nice change. The screen colours are a bit washed out but its peaseng in my opinion. I have T-Mobile and this phone allows for a 3g network so you can't talk and be on the web. Uhm, downloading games or apps in general take 5 times longer or more than a 4g phone. Over all I love the phone... Despite the camera malfunction...after just 2 days.I would add a photo but being in browser doesn't allow that option.Update:The camera works more often now, but its till blacks out from time to time. and now the phone keep cutting off, im not sure why but it doesnt really bother me i just tunr it back onand kee going. the main reason why i am willing to deal with the flaws that come with the phone because of the massive battery, i can go up to 4 days without charging the phone wich is awesome! instragram loads just fine, facebook newsfeed loads a bit slow but its not unbareable. the calling voice quality is just terrible though without the cubot bobby headphones it is jjst very muffled.","0","Unhelpful"

"5.5"" Android Cellphone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Smartphone White","JUNING","161.06","5","┬áI am so glad technology has evolved so much. From walkie talkie to a smartphone. It's such a huge leap, right? And I'm thankful to all the genius behind the creation of this technology because it has definitely made my life easier. I can still live without a smartphone but life won't ever be the same again.And talking about smartphones, I got the Juning T5 smartphone. It is an unlocked android 5.1 lollipop phone with a 5.5 inch screen size. It has all the features of a regular smartphone camera/video, sound recorder, calendar, clock, music, email, fm radio, flashlight, etc. And for full specifications, here's the linkhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01GYUDMFY/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1This is a very cool phone because of the screen resolution which is very clear. The touch screen response time is very fast too. The camera, video and sound work very well. And since this is already unlocked, you can just choose whatever carrier you want and buy a sim from them and use it on this phone and it will work without issues. Just make sure to buy the GSM/WCDMA SIM card.One of my favorite features of this phone is the smartwake feature. You just have to tap the screen and it will turn the screen on. I also like the fact that the screen size is big enough to see pictures and videos clearly or read texts without difficulty.There are many emerging new smartphones in the market nowadays but Juning smartphones are highly competitive in terms of size, features and especially price.So if you are looking for a trustworthy brand, look at Juning smartphones' direction sold by Qianhai Changying. They have plenty of models to choose from. And this particular model, the Juning T5 has a very good value for the money. It's yours for only $77.99.I got this product for free in exchanged for my honest review.","1","Helpful"

It has the same features except for the color. It has 5.5 inches screen and it has a 5.1 Android Lollipop operating system. It is lightweight and is also thin. It is super easy to use and its response time is also fast. I like this phone because it has a smart wake feature so I don't have to press the power button to wake it up. Just double tap and it will wake the phone up. I also like the fact that it's already unlocked so there is no need to pay to have it unlocked. It means that as soon as you get it, you can use it right away with any sim card of your choice. Aside from that, it is also dual sim so you can use 2 sim cards from different carriers at the same time. That for me is very amazing. You don't always find a phone with dual sim. As far as I know Samsung and Apple do not have it. So if you want to use 2 carriers but only want 1 phone then this smartphone is for you. It has all the basic features that a smartphone has so it's a gem if you ask me. A gem that only costs $77.99.I got this product for free in exchanged for my honest review.","1","Helpful"

It's a decent, well priced phone for a replacement while you wait on something better OR if you want something super simple to just make calls and text. Takes okay pictures and has a forward and rear facing camera. Audio quality is just okay. You can hear it mostly clearly, but it makes most audio sound sort of scratchy.

NO bluetooth headset support which I think should be more clear in the description. Decent range when connected to my older phone for calls with bluetooth maybe 20 or 30 feet which is pretty good. Speaker sucks and I find myself putting the corner deep in my ear to hear but it is really loud on speakerphone which just seems odd. Fits in my B.M.F. wallet just fine though I doubt it will last long with constant sitting on it and it tends to power on from the pressure. Not real fun to sit on anyway but, it is a phone!

"Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked GSM IP58-Certified WaterProof Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera and Dust Resistant - White","Sony","129.95","1","Bluetooth and wifi HARDWARE problems out of the box. no fix for it, google it before purchasing! (pushing on the back case clips back in the component to make it temporarily work)This review is based on a four day experience with the phone on at&t, I am a power user so I had plenty of time to get frustrated with it.PROS: Great size, sd card slot, camera button, battery life, notification light/bar, water resistant (I would never try to claim water proof on an electronic device), great specs.CONS: EXTREMELY washed out and over saturated screen, bluetooth and wifi do not work on my particular device and is a common problem, 0.3 megapixel front facing camera (should have just excluded it as its useless), volume button location should be above power button.I will start out by saying I chose this phone because I only use phones that are able to be used one handed. This one stretches the capabilities of that over my preferred 4.3"" screens but the low bezel makes it easier then all the others. I have been waiting months for the z1 compact to come stateside and grew impatient and decided to try a similar phone to get used to the sony platform.Sony's ui is certainly not sense or touchwiz quality but it does provide some beautiful icons and apps but is missing alot of features.The screen on this device is horrible, facebook, snapchat, instagram, youtube apps looks oddly colored due to this. Very over saturated and washed out. facebook is purple compared to the normal blue you would expect to see on any other device. custom roms may or may not fix this, I never got the chance to root my device.Rear camera takes amazing photos, camera app is odd coming from cm11 and sense but is feature rich. I mistakingly never read the specs on the front camera and it turned out to be a horrible mistake. Front camera is 0.3 megapixels with no focus. unusable.Battery life is amazing! I have never had a phone that could keep up with my usage and not need three or four bateries swapped out during theday. This device literally lasted all day on a charge and asked for more.I would not recommend this device to anyone. There are plenty other devices out there that surpass the specs for this big of a screen. Feel free to comment or ask any questions.","1","Helpful"

The phone itself is a huge disappointment. It is sooo slow. I hit a button and wait so long that I'm not even sure I hit the button. Sometimes I hit it again and then have to start all over. It is unlocked and I have never had an unlocked phone before, so I didn't realize how much trouble it would be to get it working properly with AT&T service. I had to get a full size sim card from AT&T and then the phone worked for basic calls and text messages. However, the person at the store had to call corporate AT&T to go through the steps to get the data working properly. The phone still does not accept group text messages or other multi-media messages. It gives a message that the message needs to be downloaded and then repeatedly says download unsuccessful. This is still not working. I also cannot get the screen to stay lit long enough to do much of anything. I cannot figure out how to keep the screen from going dark so quickly. I'll be trying to do something and the screen goes dark, so I have to hit the button on the side for the screen to come back on and then unlock the screen to continue what I was trying to do.

I bought this as a replacement for my husband's HTC desire that finally died. We have owned several Samsung phones and tablets over the years. This one was the most affordable of the bunch. I only have it three stars for a few eeasons. 1) The phone does not hold a charge for more than a couple of hours. 2) Finding durable cases for the phone proved challenging(although we did find one eventually on Amazon it's no OtterBox though). 3) The volume does not seem to go high enough when you are on a phone call, so it feels like you need the other person to yell just to hear them. All in all though, it's a step up from the HTC and so we are happy for now.","1","Helpful"

"Orbic Slim + X - Factory Unlocked Phone - (Gold)","","169.99","4","For what I paid as the black friday sale price, I'm tempted to give it 5 stars. If I had paid the regular price, I'd be thinking about giving it 3.Pros: It's incredibly thin and incredibly light (6.5mm thick and under 5 ounces to carry). The AMOLED screen is surprisingly vivid for the resolution and size. Though the MT6753 octocore processor is on the low end for 8 core chips, the fact this phone has 2bg RAM and ships with zero junkware makes it very responsive and fast even while multitasking. I'm going to repeat that last one: Pretty much all this has installed when you get it is Android 6 and the standard Google Apps. There's no manufacturer junkware. You will not spend a bunch of time uninstalling and disabling junk apps and you won't be fighting manufacturer installed apps that can't be uninstalled or disabled without rooting your phone or using an app manager... The MALI T720 GPU isn't necessarily all that impressive, but it performs surprisingly well in this configuration feeding the AMOLED at 1280X720. It handles 3d FPS games like NOVA3 flawlessly. The physical interface is simple having just 3 physical buttons and 3 touch sensitive buttons. The 13mp main camera is quite good with average to slightly better than average low light performance, and the camera app is pretty much like any other so casual cell phone photos won't disappoint. The 5mp user facing camera is pretty standard and good enough for video calls.Cons: The speaker is not great. It's really not great. It's OK for hands-free voice calls in a quiet room and that's about it. The speaker leaves a whole lot to be desired. You'll want to use headphones for music, watching video, or playing games because that speaker is really not very good. While I praised the image sharpness of the AMOLED screen in the ""pros"", the 1280X720 resolution is at least borderline of being a 'con' for a lot of users. There are a lot of phones in this price range that are full HD and higher. While we are talking about the display, it has a lot of bezel. Quite a lot of screen surface is wasted to that big white bezel. My screen on/off button is a little loose and rattles a bit. The battery is not user-replaceable. There is no LED notification indicator on the phone, so no visual notifications regarding charging or if you missed calls/messages. No fast charging of any sort. It charges at 1 amp period. There are no cases or screen protectors available for this phone yet. And, their website actually lists the case and screen protector for the other model phone they make as a ""related item"" to this one. Those are not ""related items"" to the Slim +X and they in no way fit this phone.Final thoughts: Battery life is a little above average as I'm getting 5+ hours of screen on time and/or a couple of days plus with just a few calls and text on the weekends. General use and productivity apps performance is very good. The multi-touch screen is just right as far as sensitivity and accuracy is concerned. Cell reception and my perceived call quality is average to good compared to other handsets I've had the last few years. WiFi performance is average to good and I probably should have listed this under the ""pros"" because the WiFi chip doesn't seem to heat the phone up very much even when doing bandwidth intensive activities. All in all, it's a good phone and a good performer across a pretty wide range of uses. I like it. There's quite a lot of competition in this price range these days and this phone is a good competitor for your money. If you're hoping for a small-ish handset (thin, light, and a little smaller than the current crop of ""phablets"") then this is an excellent choice.","1","Helpful"

"Motorola Moto X 16GB (2nd Gen 2014) - White Bamboo (SIM Free/Unlocked) UNLOCKED FACTORY","Motorola X 2nd gen XT1093","254.01","5","There are thousands of reviews out there, so having switched from an iPhone 5 I will put the most significant differences I have experienced in my review:- No local account: I have the usual cloud email accounts, a business exchange account and my own personal information stored in MS Outlook. With the iPhone I was able to sync my Outlook contacts, calendar, notes, and tasks directly to the iPhone's ""local storage"" but this version of Android forced me to sycn with one of the accounts connected to an email service. I opted to go with my Exchange account rather than G-Mail or Outlook, but I would have preferred to have it all locally stored and synced directly from Outlook rather than through a 3-rd party.- Headsets: I make heavy usage of a 3-button headset. The Moto X does not natively play well with it. I am still trying out various headset controller apps, but it should not be this annoying: Sometimes moto voice and/or ""OK, Google"" will not work, Google Play Music continuously launches on its own, I cannot hang up or pick up calls from the headset buttons, volume does not work equally in all applications, etc.- Message display: Given that this might be just me whining about changes, but I drive a lot and preferred the iPhone temporarily displaying the entire message or email header on the phone screen rather than the ""battery'saving"" icon. I still have not fond a way of making it display entirely as I want. - Love the Moto assist features. Siri is a deaf, dumb and blind simpleton when it comes to voice recognition and helpfulness. I would have been happy even if I had gotten rid of Siri's ""just to confirm, you would..."", but the Moto voice recognition is getting so seamless that I now find myself talking to it as if it was a secretary, setting alarm clocks, making calendar appointments, texting people, etc.- Miss Facetime... Even with family and acquaintances I have had a hard time getting them to go with Google Hangouts. There is always Skype, but Facetime is being missed.Overall, I believe once I get past my ""the iPhone used to..."" phase I will be extremely happy with this phone and OS.","1","Helpful"

Also, it takes a while for my Spotify app to open.2-Pictures come out pixelated. One of the features about this phone that caught my attention was the quality of the camera.

I could not wait to get rid of my Moto Q. Now (4/2008) I have the Treo 750. I'll update this review by Jan '09, but for now this phone is perfect.Jan '09 Update: The phone seems to need rebooting more than I like, but everything else is great. I still have not figured out all the features and I have never had an issue with short battery life....but then I don't talk on the phone for more than about 20 minutes a day (I have a life). This phone comes with Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, & Outlook) so you can save your files on here and then take then with you. Always get the replacement issurance plan with a phone like this.You will love the way several good devices are combined into one: Phone, Palm Pilot, Music Player, Video Player, Video Camera, Digital Camera, Document Reader, too many more to list here. Basically you can clear out all the handheld gadgets you own and replace them all with the Treo 750.","1","Helpful"

Long story short, it is a very nice phone. The pros are huge and other than no LTE in the US, the cons are all just annoying. You can get H+ speeds but not LTE...Pros: price, performance, the way the back cover works, dual sim, usb/power plug and 3.5mm audio plug on top, beautiful screen pictureCons: no LTE in the US, Chinese font on some buttons (usually very obscure places and the other button is in english so you will know what it means), takes forever to charge, themes are chinese only, bloatware (DU Speed Booster, DU Battery Saver and Clean Master) really suck.I have rather large hands so the phone feels very comfortable while I am holding it. The crisp clear screen resolution is amazing to watch video on and reading an ebook is pleasant because the screen is so large. While I was un-boxing the phone, I noticed the back cover is more than a cover, it basically is an exoskeleton around the phone. It is made of a light weight plastic type material the completely surrounds the phone. I like how the chrome buttons contrast with the bright yellow exterior. Everything about this phone just feels right in my hands. Everything is easy to reach and seems to be in the exact right spot.Once i slapped my Cricket SIM and 32GB micro sd cards into the phone, it powered right up. Setup was very common, simple and easy. I setup my google account and installed pretty much all of the google android apps to replace the included software. I have every intention of rooting the phone and removing all the included apps but I ran into issues. My phone shipped with 5.1 build VIBEUI_V2.8_1535_5.128.1_ST_K50-T5 ... This version has a locked bootloader and none of the one click root methods(kingroot nor Framaroot) work. CWR Rom Manager doesn't support the K3. Once I figure it out, I'll update the review.I started loading apps from the Play Store, about 15 or so. The phone never even paused while it installed all of those apps, one right after the next. I am very please with the performance. I paired it with a bluetooth speaker system and that went flawlessly. The sound it sends over bluetooth is crisp and clean. The few phone calls I have taken and received were both good quality.I plan on checking back in a few weeks to update my review with any new and pertinent info I'd like to share. Till then, go ahead and buy it. This may be the best bang for your buck phone on the market.","1","Helpful"

"Docomo SHARP SH-11C Unlocked Waterproof Cell Phone White","","13.77","2","I waited a bit more than a year so I could do a more proper review of this phone. First the phone is a beautiful piece of hardware, a gorgeous white phone that catches attention, the notifications are simplistic yet catching and the waterproof features do come in handy. The software though confusing at first takes a bit of time (depending on the user) but it's fun. Unfortunately though the phone didn't come unlocked which took me 2 months to find out and another 4 attempts to find a solution which happened to be a SIM card that unlocks the phone only if the cards inside (which it still becomes a hassle at times, the card does act up once in a while and I had to replace it) concluding, the phone is remarkable, just hate the money spent to unlock it","1","Helpful"

However, after only 4 - 5 weeks, my experience hasn't been as positive. It turns out I got a defective and only discovered when I started using the phone back in my home country; I can't hear calls and therefore need to use the speaker function.

"Apple iPhone 6, Space Gray, 16GB (AT&T)","Apple","345.99","2","I was going to give it 3 stars, but the text that corresponded with 3 stars was ""It's Okay"". I paused and thought about that for a second, and concluded no. No, it's not okay. The company that Steve Jobs built is self-destructing before my eyes; it' not okay. It was the only tech company that 'got it'. It's the only company that felt like the product was tested with normal people instead of just staff at the company. It's iOS that worries me, not the hardware.First off, the music app was butchered past the point of death. They are pushing Apple Music so hard that it feels like you are in an online store, not an offline app. It's littered with icons that basically cost money to touch. You don't have the option of having icons for songs, artists, albums, playlists, year or any other common-sense field that you may want to see in a music app. A ""Recently Added"" banner takes up half of the screen when you popup the music app in a desperate attempt to make people purchase songs from the store so they can see the banner change. You are unable to search more than 3 results at a time without navigating away from the search page. The list goes on, but I will stop here because one Amazon review won't stop you from worrying about the Music app.It also always prompts you to update your software every day, with no option of turning off these prompts. If it was another company, like HP, that did this, I would take it easy on their software and give this a 4 star review, but because I am witnessing one of my favorite companies (not so slowly) burn themselves to the ground, it's a much more emotional review for me. I knew that Apple would go downhill after Steve passed, but I didn't know the hill would be 90 degrees.","1","Helpful"

"Unnecto Air 4.5 - Unlocked (White)","Unnecto","69.99","3","I'm hoping I might get my issue resolved through an RMA replacement. I bought the grey 4.5 Air in Feb'16. Loved it. Love it still, other than a SIM pin may have gotten bent as the SIM chip was being removed to dry the phone after its swim ( ...like it's never happened to you...) Dried it off as well as possible, popped it into a bag of rice for 2 days and voila, all data intact, apps work, WIFI works... but it won't make calls, only 911s, and won't text. I expect this is the SIM platform, what actually holds the chip. Also will not synchronize the proper time, date or year.So I bought a white 4.5 Air to replace it, and THIS one is just as great EXCEPT it does not get mobile data and my carrier confirmed I *AM* paying a flat rate for my mobile data. The phones are precisely the same model, just different color backs. But the white may have had, or did not have, an upgrade which woud have made it unequal to the grey phone. I can come back after whatever happens with the white phone happens and give another review on their customer service.","1","Helpful"

I always have battery saver on, close all applications, wi-fi off, ect, and make 1-2 short calls in a day and a few texts. This phone lasts 24 hours or less on a full charge.

Long story short, I have an iPhone but don't want an Apple Watch. I want a smartwatch that's more of a standalone watch. I'm jealous of Samsung phone pwners who can get a watch that accepts SIM cards and can be used as a standalone device. After seeing YouTube videos that a Samsung Gear or Gear 2 can be paired with an iPhone, I bought both of them to try them out with my iPhone. I'm wearing the Gear 1 right now. The Gear 1 is Android based and I can sideload Play Store apps on it without the aid of a Samsung phone.I bought this, among other smart watches, to be able to pair with my iPhone and use as a stand alone phone watch. Samsung watches provide limited usage with an iPhone so I decided to try smartwatches straight from China. I decided to try this watch and it didn't work out. It didn't pair with my iPhone even though the specs stated that it would. Had to return it.","1","Helpful"

"Nokia Lumia 620 Yellow, Factory Unlocked, International Version, Win8 Phone - No Warranty","","89","5","I've been using this phone since June 2013 and it works perfectly fine since! All the features works and the touchscreen is very responsive, although, I suggest you buy a screen protector if you don't want to get any stratches on there. The only downside I see to this phone is the thickness of it and removing the back panel is a bit testing as you have to apply some force to your camera/led flash. Being a mid-range smartphone, a plus is that it features NFC capabilities. The battery life for this phone is also amazing (compared to other rivals at the same price range). Here is a list of the specs and disadvantages (from GSMArena.com).-Specifications:Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE supportQuad-band 3G with 21 Mbps HSDPA and 5.7 Mbps HSUPA support3.8"" 16M-color ClearBlack LCD display with WVGA resolution5 megapixel autofocus camera with LED flash, 720p@30fps video recordingVGA front-facing cameraWindows Phone 8 OS1.0 GHz dual-core Krait CPU, Adreno 305 GPU, 512 MB of RAMWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-bandGPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support8 GB of inbuilt storage, expandable through the microSD card slot (up to 64 GB)Active noise cancellation with a dedicated micBuilt-in accelerometer, gyroscope and proximity sensorStandard 3.5 mm audio jack1300 mAh user-replaceable batterymicroUSB port with file transfersBluetooth v3.0 with A2DP and EDRNFC supportFull Office Mobile experienceGreat build qualityFree lifetime voice-guided navigation via Nokia DriveExcellent social integrationXbox Live integration and Xbox managementNokia Music streaming serviceFM Radio7 GB worth of SkyDrive storageAttractive price-Main disadvantagesWP app catalog falls short of Android and iOSNo system-wide file managerNo lockscreen shortcutsRemoving the back panel is testingOverall (tl;dr): If you're looking at an affordable priced smartphone and like the Windows 8/8.1 OS better than Android/iOS, I suggest you buy this phone, one of the best smartphones you can get for the price; happy buying!","1","Helpful"

The keyboard lags, the phone overheats constantly and gives a message saying ""remove battery"", which is not possible. Phone dies quickly and charges slowly. No screenshot capabilities, takes forever to open a program, will randomly restart. Also, you can't buy a case that fits it because the buttons are in a weird spot. I dropped it once and the back shattered, which I've never seen on a phone. Now it's coming off in very sharp plastic pieces, allowing the inside of the phone to be exposed to dust and other things. I'm sure that won't help its performance at all. Definitely not worth the money and regret the purchase.","1","Helpful"

"SIAM 7X Dual Screen, Dual Sim Smartphone With 16 MP Camera, SMS Audio, Android 5.1 Lollipop, (White)","SIAM","249","1","I wish I could give this positive marks but it was pretty disappointing right out of the box. It is extremely heavy. I don't think I've ever owned a cell phone that weighed this much. It is not comfortable to hold and feels like a brick. This is not the best Android version OS for this phone either. Generally when you have a phone that does not have a physical back button or a home button, the operating system has some sort of controls on the screen so you can navigate your phone. It took me a while to figure out how to exit the camera app because you had to swipe up to find a back button to exit the app. The e-reader side is pretty useless and poorly designed. Not only is the screen nonresponsive to touch (though it is meant to be) but the rear display is glossy rather than matte. This means that you'll get an incredible glare off the screen in the sun. What a bummer. As a Yotaphone 2 owner I have to say this doesn't come anywhere close to the design and quality of the Yotaphone. Unlike the Yotaphone, the e-ink display on this is app based, so whatever app they have is what you'll get out of the e-ink display. The apps are pretty weak to say the least. The e-reader app was the worst, with the e-reader store taking you straight to some Chinese site. With the Yotaphone I was able to mirror anything that was on the front screen and operate the phone using the rear screen as well as use any app on my phone. Overall the Siam 7X is an overpriced, prehistoric phone with a cheap e-reader on the back.","1","Helpful"

"Polaroid Snap S55WH 5.5"" Unlocked Phone Android 5.1, 4G LTE, Back & Front Flash","Polaroid","127.08","4","The Polaroid Snap S55PK has a lot of awesome features at a price that won't break the bank. With that being said, this phone has it's ups and downs. Most of the downs can be corrected by following some simple steps. Below you will find some of my personal experiences with this phone and the steps I did to correct the small issues in the time that I have had it so far:The phone has 8GB of memory. Half of which is being utilized by the operating system. When you receive the phone it is going to have about 4GB of free space. If you want to get the best out of this phone, it is recommended to purchase a micro sd card (not one of the fancy ones, just a simple micro sd card not to exceed 32GB). The tricky part is that right out of the box the phone does not have the capability to save files to the memory card.I had to navigate to settings - about phone - system update and run 2 updates on the phone. After the 2nd update (dated 4/20/2016) applied to the phone, I was then able to set the phone to write to the sd card instead of the 4GB of space on the phone. One issue I have not been able to resolve, is that this setting allows for the newly installed applications to automatically save to the sd card, but this setting does not allow the pictures to automatically save to the sd card.In order to get the pictures to save to the sd card, you have to go into file management and locate the folder in which your pictures are saved. You would hold your finger down on one of the pictures which will make a drop down menu appear at the top. The drop down menu will have the option to 'select all'. After you select all, you will have the option to 'cut' or 'copy' the selected photos. Once you do this, you will want to immediately go back to the beginning of file management, locate or create a folder that you want to save the files to on your sd card and then paste them there. Keep in mind, if you select the 'copy' option instead of the 'cut' option, you are only placing a copy in the sd card and not actually clearing the space on your phone. If you are trying to clear the space on your phone, you will want the 'cut' option.Make sure you are using a phone charger that is compatible with this phone's ratings. I used a car charger with mine that I have had for quite some time and started receiving messages stating that the battery was overheating and I needed to remove the battery. The phone was really not to touch (not the battery, surprisingly enough) and took a while to cool down. I have not had this error prior to using that charger or since I used that charger, so I'm left to believe that the charger just isn't compatible. I have not read about this phone having battery issues or power issues, so here's to hoping that was just a one time fluke.I love the 5.5"" screen size, the bright and vivid screen/colors, the smoothness of the android 5.1 operating system. The phone is a really bright pink, so don't think you'll get by with buying this phone as a potential gift for your brother like I was thinking. I've decided I might have to keep this one for myself and invest in the blue one for him. ;-)I see one potential problem arising from the design of the phone and that's the camera lens. It isn't indented into the phone like most camera phones are. If you lay your phone down, the camera lens will be touching the surface of whatever you set it on which can easily get scuffed or break. I will have to keep this review updated with that information as more time passes.* I received this item at discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review*","1","Helpful"

For a while, the GPS navigation wasn't working but it is now, so I don't know what changed - fingers crossed that nothing happens to mess that up.Another issue is that the home, back, and list buttons aren't as sensitive as I would like them, and sometimes have to press the sensors multiple times for them to act. However, the screen itself is quite sensitive and the clarity and resolution are fantastic. The screen size is just right and fits into my palm perfectly.I'll update the review if anything changes, but so far, so good.","1","Helpful"

"Nokia 5140 Phone (Unlocked)","Nokia","224.1","3","My 5140i is 8 years old. Still works, the battery still last about 7 days. But the cover totally desintegrated and the chinese aftermarket covers I was able to find don't last a month (the flip out rubber cover at the base the protects the ports falls off within days). So, since I am no fan of smart phones, and frankly there is no other rugged phone (with termometer, compass, flashlight, noise meter) that is available in Europe I was amazed to see the new 5140s on Amazon.The delivery was prompt, I got it in 4 days.The product however is a nothing short of dissappointment. The ""original"" is made in Hungary, in an official Nokia factory (no longer exists I think), this one on the other hand came from Hong Kong. Made in China. The batteries, also chinese (two included) last for 2 days (and because the quality of assembly is dismal it doest fit properly), the bottom half (for some reson the keys have latin and hebrew letters too) of the case doesn't attach to the top half (which by the way doesn't have the level to help calibrate the compass).My rating is 3/5, mainly because I want to give it a shot, see how long it will last. So it's based on my love for the brand and the original product. If I was new to this particular phone I would have given it 2 stars out of 5.The op system is slightly updated but no longer has the Polar Fitness watch support.","1","Helpful"

Regardless of if I use Googlemaps, Waze, or Here, it tells me to get off the freeway and get back on every few miles, when I am traveling a while on the freeway. I've never had this problem with another phone, and it has to be the app, since the same problem occurs in Googlemaps, Waze and Here. Browsing is good, can call in and out fine. wifi is fine. Speakerphone is still kind of sucky, and for some reason they put the speakerphone towards the bottom of the phone (it should be located at the top of the phone since that is the part closest to your ear if you are holding it). PROBLEM 2: initially I had trouble figuring out how the SIM CARDS and SD CARD are inserted. I finally figured it out. SIM/slot 1 (main SIM), is underneath SIM2 and the SD card, and has to be inserted horizontally and must be inserted CHIP SIDE UP. SIM slot 2 is the on top and to the left and is inserted horizontally CHIP SIDE DOWN. The SD card is on the top right side and is inserted vertically CHIP SIDE DOWN. Wish they had video for the SIM CARDS and SD Cards particularly since it can vary from phone to phone and is not that obvious. Also if you need to change the cellular/mobile networks settings on your phone (which you probably will need in order to receive MMS texts, etc.), you have to not be talking on the phone at the same time in order to change the settings - otherwise, the settings will be greyed out/you will be unable to click on said settings.

AC Charger is (I'm assuming) German, so though the USB itself is universally compatible, you'll need to use or buy a different wall adapter.It's in Lollipop, I believe, and easily upgrades to Marshmallow (and even Nougat!) soon. However, it must charge halfway before you can do that (Was at about 10% for me), and the series of updates gets it *extremely* hot. Speaking of which, CPU overheating happens terrifyingly frequently, though I should say that I can't notice any performance problems, just the absurd temperature rise (115F+) and some battery drain.Pros:Now, the battery - when you have it in normal mode it's unremarkable. Drains at a standard rate. BUT, when you switch it to ""Stamina"", sweet baby Jesus. Essentially, it doubles the battery life. Of course, one would assume this takes a serious toll on performance - but only two (quite tolerable) perceivable changes happens. The brightness becomes to adaptive brightness what adaptive brightness is to 100%. Basically, it's a bit darker than adaptive brightness at 100%. Though, I already have it at adaptive - having it at full, 100% brightness before turning Stamina on seems to put it at regular adaptive brightness.That paragraph was aggressively confusing, sorry folks. The other thing is that internet apps such as Snapchat and Kik will not give you notifications *until you open them once after Stamina is on*. This means that Stamina force stops them, and you can get your notifications back once you open them. You can also make exceptions to what apps Stamina optimizes in the battery settings. I'm sure Stamina also strongly affects your network and internet speed/usage, so if you're an avid mobile gamer you might want to keep it off (or get the Xperia XZ!)Here's how long the battery lasts for me (if I were to do these individual tasks and only them straight from a full charge until it died):Standby: 2 days / Stamina: 4 daysInternet Browser (no videos): 12 hours / Stamina: 18 hoursMusic: 1 day / Stamina: 3 daysVideo (local or streaming): 6 to 9 hours for both, depends on quality and all thatCalls (video): 2 to 5 hours for both, again probably depends on qualityCamera/Recording (rear): See ""Video""Snapchat, specifically: Just... Just kill your phone. Just put it in the oven. Same effect.Info I can't help you with:Calls (audio): Well, I can't test that very easily, but I'd guess around 12Games: Hell if I know, I hate mobile gaming. Plus if you play games on a phone and you're considering a compact, you seriously need to rethink the way you choose your tech. But probably 6-ish.Oh boy, I've been waiting to talk about this part: MEDIA(23 MP) Camera: It's so yummy. The images are so crisp. The colors bounce off each other so well. You can take a picture of a freaking desk chair and it will be impressive. You have a host of size and focus settings, and a bunch of subtle (though you can adjust them to make yourself look like an idiot on Snapchat) color filters. And yes, there is 4K recording. But there's some Jekyll and Hyde going on here. Turn off one too many lights, and NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE. It will look like Barney the Dinosaur jammed his hand into a blender and tossed the bits all around like confetti. Use the flash.Display: They fit as much pretty as the can into a lackluster 720p size. You have a couple of settings that will allow you to add more realism or straight up saturation to your photos/videos. Motion is swift and crisp.Music: Dear lord, if you are an audiophile or even a pseudo-audiophile such as myself, get yourself a Sony phone. A few accessory/media specs before I go into this: I've been using Shure SE215 earphones to listen to mostly film scores (such as Hans Zimmer) and theatrical rock (such as Muse) on Poweramp Music Player with the EQ/Tone leaning slightly towards low bass, low mids, and high treble frequencies (and away from the rest).It's so beautiful. The instrumental separation is phenomenal. I can't describe it much in a way other than this - if your average phone is a kid flapping a leather cape from Spirit Halloween into a phone mic and playing it back through Beats headphones, this is the sound of Batman's cape fluttering in the wind as he dive bombs. It's sophisticated and elegant, but powerful, with deadpan presentation. It has closer to a monitor sound, rather than leaning towards bass or mids the way most phones do, so it's more customizable.You have a ridiculously, hilariously, mind-bogglingly expansive wealth of audio settings, from an algorithm that attempts to present 16-bit/44khz audio as 24-bit/96khz to Sony's classic dynamic normalizer to a truly absurd selection of surround sound settings. The in-house EQ is pretty lame, which is why I don't use their default music player, but the HR audio upgrade is compatible with power amp. You are also able to play originally 24/96 audio files *at that quality*! Your iPhones and your Galaxies won't do that. Shame that I'm sending that through 16/44headphones though, which defeats the purpose. Overall, sound quality is unparalleled by non-Xperias and the best part of the phone.Customization: Yes, there are themes, and some of them are pretty cool, but don't get them through the settings or the What's New app! Go straight to the Play Store. Try ""Cubot"" - it's free and customizes just about everything in Sony's UI to a *very* cool blue/black theme.TL;DR: Photographer: It's a great choice. Gamer: Stay away! Audiophile: Get this phone immediately!9/10","1","Helpful"

My other phone was serviceable, but 3 years old and starting to get buggy in it's erratic behavior, so this one is faster, bigger and beautiful. My only hiccup is the phone has a little icon in the corner prompting me to download Kitkat, and there are several online reviews vehemently warning against the pairing of this device and Kitkat! The reminder will not go away, nor can it be deleted and feels a bit like impending doom. In the mean time it meets my needs nicely and does not have the same big fat price tag as it's competitors. Hooray for a way to beat the system of pricey phone service. I would really give this phone 4.5 stars. :)","1","Helpful"

"Samsung Google Nexus S - Unlocked GSM Phone International Version/Warranty 3G Bands 900/1700/2100","Samsung","69.95","4","Short and sweet review:I purchased a like new, unlocked version of this phone for $200 - an EXCELLENT deal - in July 2012 because I was ready to make the full switch to Android, but I just didn't have the money for a Galaxy Nexus. You might want to get yourself a nice little case if you ever drop the thing, as well as an additional charger (maybe a car charger) because this battery drains pretty fast. I might be able to go a full day with about 30% battery to spare at the end of the day, but that's ONLY when I sparingly use the device and listen to Google Play Music for roughly two hours or so.In spite of battery drain, I am immensely enjoying the phone. I love all of the Google services that are connected to the device; I love that when I brought it I was one of the few that had Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich off the bat, and now I'm one of the FEWER that has Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. Now ironically, I'd be surprised if I get the next version of Android, because even with Google's ""Project Butter"", there is still a bit of lag within Chrome, as well as lag when I open and close a few apps. Most of the top notch Android phones these days have 1GB of RAM, and I certainly see the necessity of that as 512MB of RAM (which this phone has) can cause some hiccups on streaming playback which is a nuisance, but hasn't soured me on both the Android and phone experience.Quite frankly, when going for an Android device - either high end or low end - I'd have to recommend to do your research on the pros and cons of what you are looking for. I say this because even though I'm enjoying this phone, many have said that I also have the ""patience of Job (biblical character)"", and I could see the frequent ""pops"" during music streaming playback greatly annoying a listener. Also, if you're not deeply ingrained in many of Google's services, you might find it hard to enjoy it or even switch from another service (such as iOS/Apple). Personally, I came from an iPhone 3GS and an iPad, but it was a seamless transition because Google+ backs up all of my photos, all 80GB of my music is on Google Play, and fortunately many of the apps I used on iOS are either on Google's Play Store or there is an Android alternative. I'm not sure if I would recommend this - or any Android phone - to my parents just yet. My biggest concern is the battery drain and I'd have to research a phone that can last a full day without major drain; and that is the key for any person shopping for Android - RESEARCH.I don't know if I'll have this phone by this time next year - hopefully I'll be able to afford the latest Nexus coming out at the end of 2012; or maybe the Galaxy Nexus will be just as wise of a purchase in 2013 as the Nexus S was for me this year in 2012. Either way, I am extremely pleased with my purchase, especially since this is my first Android device and leaves me with an overall positive experience.","1","Helpful"

My second Huawei phone and the quality of their products has only gotten better imo. The design and build quality of this phone makes the jet black iphone look ordinary and the battery life makes the iphone look pathetic. I don't mind the EMUI that much, but am a real fan of Google Now, so went straight to that launcher. The settup was pretty easy, though it did not simply mirror my apps and settings from my other phone, so I had to download and install my favorite apps one at a time. Since the phone is so fast, that did not take much time and it gave me the chance to explore settings and features while I was doing the tasks. Camera results are superb though I have much more to learn about the options and features provided. Signal strength for both wifi and network are the best I've had in my rural local. So far I'm totally pleased with this item and found a case I really like, though I'd much rather use the phone without a case. That is not, however, a practical every day option.

Display is bright and very nice, not galaxy amoled bright but a nice screen anyway. The skin isn't too over bearing it's pleasant and easy to work with. Of course battery lasts well over a day, I had 45% leftover by bedtime. I was happy the phone came with its own screen protector and case. I wish it used microsd card but 32GB internal was ok.

"Nokia X2 (X2-00) RED ON BLACK Unlocked Phone","Nokia","269.1","5","I got a fake phone and told the seller to switch suppliers. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they unknowingly were selling fake Nokia X2's. I bought a real one from another website. In the meantime, the seller was very courteous and ensured I got a full refund on the shipping AND the return shipping!The speaker was damaged (creating a crackling), one speaker didn't work at all (stereo speakers were advertised), the package included a tacky shiny ""original"" sticker, the OVI cd was missing, the packaging box looked like it was printed on an inkjet printer with ink smears, the booklet was made of low quality paper and missing the sleek acrylic paper used for the cover page, the package had been opened, the phone's outer body has a cheap feel to it, and I could separate the screen from the phone's housing with my fingernail.Don't get me wrong, the electronics and software inside the phone seemed to be authentic. The operation of the phone was speedy. Everything else seemed fake. If you like a well-constructed phone with good speakers, then look elsewhere.I compared it to an authentic Nokia X2 and the difference was night and day. The real one I found to be only $91 USD elsewhere (2013, May), it took 1 month to arrive in Canada, but it was worth it, and I got it shipped free. I got a true comparison of what a real genuine Nokia X2 is supposed to feel and sound like. This phone is loud and the quality of the music is great after you set the equalizer to tone down on the treble. The construction of the genuine phone is solid and I cannot separate the LCD screen from the phone's housing.","1","Helpful"

It has these 'group divisions' (family, work,etc) to store phone numbers but it doesn't work. It doesn't have settings to send your sms messages to the memory card which has a greater capacity for storage, it sends them to the mini phone memory. Video and music have not mp3 or mp4 or any other 'normal' file extension, you have to convert them first the the weird phone's file extension.

Size wise it is similar to the earlier generation Xperia Ion so it is amazing engineers at Sony are able to pack a massive 5 inch screen into the tiny body. Though perhaps because of the sheer size of the screen, the front facing camera is placed at an awkward position which makes any kind of video calls funky.Feature wise this phone can give the Galaxy S4 a run for its money.Sony has been making great phones since separated from the failed joint venture with Ericsson. Unfortunately, the marketing arm doesn't seem to know a thing or two about the US mobile market. This phone is priced competitively with other ""unlocked"" devices like iPhone and Galaxy S4, but in the US there is almost no meaningful market for ""unlocked"" devices.

Also check fourms @ android area51 and don't forget your friends @ xda a lot of good info. I hope this helps someone cause finding info on this phone is few and far between. But I enjoy this phone. And theirs really no need to root this phone. Like I said I wanted the old web browser. But its not worth soft bricking to get it","1","Helpful"

"SPOT Global Phone - Lightweight Handheld Satellite Phone","","375","2","This is basically a Globalstar phone with a Spot logo, billed through Spot on the Globalstar network. Spot was running a deal where they rebate you $250 on the $500 price. Not bad, but other vendors will give it to you for free with airtime plan:[...] The phone arrived on time but there is a prominent nick in the plastic on the face of the display. Not a showstopper but still irritating. The original UPC on the box was covered with a sticker that had apparently been applied by the dealer. Spot's rebate instructions clearly state the original UPC must be submitted so I have some concern I will ever see the rebate. If you are not familiar with a satellite phone you should be aware that quite a bit of open sky is required to get a signal, much more than is required for GPS or XM radio. But here's the kicker, reason I rated it so low: The phone has its outgoing caller ID blocked, so, for example, when I call my own home phone number, I get the message ""the party you have called does not accept calls from phones that have caller ID blocked"" and the call does not go through. I verified this ""feature"" with Spot customer service. They said they were aware of it and were working with the carrier (Globalstar) to get it removed, but could offer no timeline for when anything might happen. So here is a phone that would presumably be of use to reach out for help, search and rescue, etc., that is in ""Secret Agent"" mode and may very likely not connect with a number you may dearly want to reach. Ridiculous.","1","Helpful"

The seller made no mention of this, the listing page said nothing of this, and the seller feedback I provided about this was struck through by Amazon since it was ""fulfilled by Amazon."" It arrived with a UK powerplug by BlackBerry, and a cheap plastic non-UL certified adapter that the seller provided; it wouldn't stay in the wall, as the prongs were the same size instead of industry standard, and after a minute or two was hot to the touch. Make sure to ask the seller what version the device is, as I didn't have a UK power adapter and their included solution was frankly unsafe.The phone itself, had I gotten it when it first released, would have been an instant love affair.The size takes getting used to, but having a phone this wide makes sense for two handed use and really fits well if you have larger hands. The software is smooth, no crashes have occurred and the update process is smooth. I've got a few Android apps running, and the only thing that happens is the music from apps like Spotify or Groove might automatically pause - a simply tap on the play key brings it right back each time.The OS is effectively dead, but the navigation via the touch sensitive keyboard is smart and really makes you wish for the days of Palm; BlackBerry really had something here, even though it obviously didn't appeal to enough people to keep their vision afloat. The main thing I've been surprised with is that it's a really good PHONE - calls and messaging are really where this phone shine, and speaker calls or using a headset make the experience impressive.The typing experience took me two days before I got the hang of it, soon the gestures and shortcuts became second nature and speed was back to normal. If you're coming from the Q10 or Classic and the like the onscreen numbers are the biggest change, but acclimating isn't hard. The Hub is always a favorite feature, whenever I go back to BlackBerry having everything in one place just makes it so much nicer compared to having multiple apps you have to check, and works great with multiple email accounts and work.Battery life is excellent, and I routinely get through the day with 70% of the battery left and ready to go. The device is sturdy, you don't really feel the need for a case here, and the textured backing is much improved over the normal Passports version.There are quirks, the camera takes a second to focus and makes it easier to lose fast moving targets; it's also not the best in low light, so keep that in mind. Video watching on a square screen is obviously going to be hard and less enjoyable, so if you're a YouTube/Netflix junkie this probably isn't a good choice. The browser also takes issue with certain sites security certificates (gfycat is the main one that comes to mind) since it's no longer getting updates, and whitelisting isn't always something it lets you do.Picking a Passport SE in 2016 is weird, but if you're a light app user or not invested into Google's ecosystem you'll find a unique experience that brings back the days when phones were for business and getting work done was paramount. It's an OS that's no longer being developed, by a company that once was an industry juggernaut, but their care and expertise show.","1","Helpful"

"OtterBox Rugged Defender Series for iPhone 5/5s/SE - Hornet (Yellow/Black)","OtterBox","39","1","When I upgraded my iPhone 4 to a 5S I immediately knew I wanted another Defender due to how well my previous one had protected my 4. If you like to use the fingerprint technology on your 5S then I guess this Defender will have to do. I never had any intention of using my fingerprints but bought this thing anyway. Big mistake. To accommodate this technology this particular model of Defender leaves the home button exposed which, in turn, allows dirt, debris, even water to penetrate under the protective screen. I had to remove this case weekly to clean under it. The final straw was when it allowed a dog hair and water to reach the top of the phone. I eventually bought one of the discontinued Defenders designed for the original iPhone 5. It doesn't allow you to use your fingerprint but it does a massively better job a keeping out dirt and moisture. Bottom line, if you don't use the fingerprint technology then do not buy this one, but one of the older models.","1","Helpful"

Hmmm.....UPDATE 11/6/2016= This phablet's been great, but gotta remove one star as the USB mini port is one area the manufacturer shouldn't have cheaped out on. Cable will fall out, as many other reviewers have said. WORKAROUND: Buy a thicker mini USB charging cable, and make sure the casing around the mini USB connector is thick. I just happened to have one such cable lying around. It works better than those thin cables. It won't completely fix the issue, but it'll definitely help. You can also do your own fixes, search YouTube for ""how to fix loose mini USB connector,"" and (I can't stress this enough) FOLLOW DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY. This will help.Packaging/unboxing=Very beautiful phablet! Nice! Quite sleek and thin. Really thin. Nice color. Open the back carefully, at the top middle, then gingerly work your way around the whole thing, take it slow. It actually came with an American USB adapter/wall charger, not European, thank you very much. Comes with this , well....""screen protector, "" which I didn't use cuz I couldn't see through it, so I took it off. Battery takes a veery long time to charge, it'll take about 12-14 hours for full charge. Unless, of course, you leave it idle whilst it charges. If in heavy use while on charge, it'll take a very long time. If you're looking for a device that'll hold a charge longer, keep looking.Turning phablet on/Google account setup: Flawless. Everything transferred, even my Spotify app transferred all songs , playlists even though I've got it running on my other phone with the same account. I'm just using my Leagoo for internet, music, games, etc. So I can't remark about calls. Hooking up to my Wi-Fi was a bit weird took about a minute to set up, but works just fine. it had a bit of a stutter for awhile, getting all those apps back on.Root access granted. I didn't do a firmware update for obvious reasons. Thank goodness, my trusty Viper Audio is bangin' my fave Spotify songs whilst I write this. Niiice. And no older-operating-system sputtering and closing down my music app. That said: You can definitely multi task with this.Games=I've only tried survival Craft. It has very few issues, just a couple hhiccups. But it definitely plays better than on my kit kat. But survival Craft can get pretty demanding on your memory, depending upon how heavy you play it. You might want to manually shut some apps down so you have more memory for those demanding games. I've also tested out a few other games yesterday, they work great, no sputtering.All said: I definitely recommend this phablet. Give this one a try!","1","Helpful"

"LG G3 LG-F400 Quad HD IPS 32GB Silk White Factory Unlocked OIS Plus Camera","LG","698.69","4","Alright, I have been using this phone for over a month now and I think I have experienced all kinds of things with this phone from good to bad.Contents:The Good-Awesome screen.-Less eye strain.-Slick design and Premium feels.-Excellent Performance.The Okay?-Camera-Speakers-Reception-Battery LifeThe Awful-Software Glitch-OverheatingMore precise review:Goods:Beginning with the screen, whenever you use this phone, no matter how long the time has passed, you'll think ""Man, I love this phone."" There is a reason to why this phone is named the best of the year and LG proves it with the very first ever Quad-HD screen. Apple used to say that pixel density doesn't need to be improved from a certain point due to the limits of the human eye. Well, LG disproved them hard. This phone has a crazy amount of pixel density (538dpi) compared to a 401dpi of an iphone 6. I do believe that high pixel density matter due to the smoothness of the text you will find whenever you are texting, browsing, or reading. It reduces the eye strain by how natural the electronic texts feel. I sometimes feel a lot more comfortable looking at my LG G3 phone than an actual book. As a person who loves to read, this is a fantastic bonus.Aside from the screen, this phone is just beautiful. You know how some people just looks better in real life than in pictures? Yeah, this phone is exactly like it. Although the screen is 5.5 inches, LG has reduced the indentation on the side of the phone by so much that the ration of the width and height cannot get more perfect than this. Some wondered if the thinness of the width would get in way when you are using it in one hand. But according to my usage, nope, there is not a problem and actually, applications are much easier to reach within the screen with a single hand due to the shortness of the width size.Also, some complained about the buttons in the back. But that really isn't a problem. And actually, when this phone is in your pocket, it's a lot more comfortable to use this phone as the buttons are reachable by tapping your lap instead of grabbing the phone to change the volume of your music in an iPhone or that Samsung. The back buttons actually have a more natural feeling than the other phones out there when you get used to it.Oh and don't forget that this phone's performance is good enough for all kinds of users (casual - gaming).Tip: Update this phone and you get a better software that does a lot more things.The Okays:Now, I am a hardcore photography hobbyist. That means, I carry a DSLR camera with bunch of prime and high-end lenses.Within the professional point of view, although the laser AF is great, there needs a lot of work with the low light situations. In a bright day light, the pictures are fine for casual usage and there is this color splashing that happens within the camera that most of the pictures you'll take will look blur.(It is sharp, but something makes it seem blur....) I understand this blur-ness for the selfie camera since everyone wants to look good with awesome smooth skins right? But I don't see the purpose of this for the front facing camera. I don't really know why people are praising this phone so much for its camera, but it's not that great. At least, from a professional point of view. But I guess compared to other phones and my old one (Samsung Galaxy S3), it's a lot better.But this is the killing point. When you are in a darkness, I understand that the phone has to pump up the ISO since it doesn't have a lot of lenses. But man! The ISO is way to noisy. Even when you phone is lacking a bit in light, the ISO will be bumped up and kill the picture. It's almost impossible to take a clear picture at night.Aside from the camera, the speaker is fine. It's loud and clear. And personally, I'm quite fine with what's it's producing. But there is something that is lacking within the speakers and I don't know what it is.Oh, and about the battery life. It really depends on what kind of user you are. But overall, the biggest drainage IS going to be your screen. When the phone is at stand-by or when it uses a dimmer light, the battery will last a bit more than 17 hours. But once you start brightening that screen, it could even die within 5 hours. 3000MHz is a lot of juice. But a bright screen will kill the battery. Just use it in dimmer mode and you'll be fine. Amazingly, the high pixel density of this phone provides a clear view of whats in the screen despite how dim it is.***Using this phone with mp3 will last for around 8-15 hours depending on the volume.Terrible:Software. Software. Software.Now don't get me wrong, the design UI and how the phone works is perfect. But from time to time, this phone will restart by itself for no reason. Although this never happened to my when I was doing something important (ex; calling), it does bother me.Now automatic shut down isn't the only problem I encountered. Recently, I faced a exhausting problem where the phone would stop making appointed notifications and alarms. At one point, even text messaging became impossible. I did everything in my power as a Computer Science student to fix this phone. And when even the factory reset didn't fix this phone, I kind of gave up. (Apparently, even with factory reset, the phone stays with the latest firmware.) I believe it is a glitch met within the android and the LG software. I'm not sure what was causing the problem, but after some time of tinkering tons of options, I finally got it work. But seriously, I was even considering to sell this phone (more like I wondered if I can even sell it...)By the way, this phone gets really hot when you play video games or do any high processing tasks. Beware with you ears! It's burning hot.","2","Helpful"

Just make sure everything works before leaving but in the end everything should work fine.

I have had several of their phones over the years, and this is one of the worst. Very pixelated, washed out screen, that finds no redemption in it's needing several taps on things to register, whacky scrolling, and sometimes you'll end up clicking on something else entirely. Cheap all around, and even it's lightly modified UI is buggy! I wanted to like this because of the snazzy color that set it apart, but I have to warn potential customers -- don't do it!

From the moment I opened the package this phone was way bigger then expected. I used a straight talk GSM sim card. The set up was very easy. It's also very pink. Which I am in love with. The camera let's just say, I can sit down on my bed. Using the reverse camera and see my whole body! The quality is very impressive for the price. I was very skeptical about receiving this phone.

"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black","BlackBerry","149.99","5","Absolutely amazing phone! I was looking for a physical keyboarded phone with modern specs. This phone definitely delivers. I was using a miniature tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and it was simply too large, it was a great media consumption phone, but I simply didn't get my money's worth in that regard. I wanted a better email experience and Blackberry has offered that! It is working superbly, the keys are easy to use with my big hands, and it really isn't all that much slower than my Note 3 despite that being a quad-core and the Classic being a dual-core.The ""toolbelt"" is also very useful and it gives you some better ways to interact with the phone compared to the Q10 and Z10. Overall, the addition of the Amazon app-store and side loading makes this phone a no-brainer, it has any app you could ever use, and you get a far more secure phone than that of the iOS hacks, and Google's known issues with data privacy. Here's an option for those that want a phone that is an alternative to the duopoly of Droid and iOS, and yet you don't have to sacrifice anything in order to have that ability.I think the best aspect of the phone is that you don't have to exit a app in order to look at a new notification, you simply swipe up and to the right and you can ""peek"" at the notification. If it's someone you want to talk to you can choose to leave the app from the gesture, or swipe left and stay on the app or process you were using previously","2","Helpful"

It's fast and the big 5.5"" inch screen is making things on the screen bigger and easy to read. I've been using this mainly for watching Youtube. My son loves using this as the screen is way bigger as compared to my iPhone 5C.This also came with a screen protector and a clear case that's a little gray in color. It is a dual sim card phone and you can also put an SD card inside the phone if you want to expand the memory.The only downside of this phone is the lack of internal space memory. I can't freely download anything I want into this phone because there's not enough space and right now I don't have a spare SD card to use for this phone. I really wish that for a nice phone like this, they should just make this an 8GB memory space rather than 4GB.Over all, this phone works as expected. For the price it's fair and a good size Android phone to have especially if you like YouTube or watch videos online.","2","Helpful"

I recently decided to verify that it was in fact unlocked.It's not.The phone did not come unlocked, and no unlock code was included with the original shipment. This listing's title needs to be updated, or the seller, Joycell, needs to accurately post their wares. I specifically purchased using this listing because it was unlocked, and the price seemed reasonable. Had I know it wasn't unlocked, I wouldn't have purchased it.Fortunately, I put in an unlock request with AT&T, and they granted it. However, I've had those turned down before for other phones, and I would have been in a bad situation if they had chose not to allow it.The phone itself is great, and once again, the 1-star rating is for this specific listing.

I highly recommend this cellphone it's awesome and it's a fast dual core phone for under 300$ with samsung quality, jellybean and apps runs smoothly, the screen is really good with very deep blacks (better than the S3 mini) obviously you can't compare it with a galaxy S3 or S4 wich are way more expensive, the phone is very stylish, thin and light. After a month of use i can tell you it's fast, turning it on and shutting it off is very quick, no bugs at all with jellybean, the camera is awesome, very nice quality pics even if you're moving and even in low light environments. The phone is not too big not too small, just right. The quality of the sound processing is amazing, with a nice pair of headphones you'll notice the difference and the speakers are good too. Haven't try heavy 3d gaming but with normal android games (angry birds, fruit ninja, plants vs zombies, etc)and emulators (NES, SNES, GBA, MAME)it runs smoothly. Finally the battery life is amazing, with the app battery saver and minimum brightness (even with minimum brightness the screen looks nice and clear, no need for more unless you're outdoors)you'll get a whole day of battery life without problems, my use is regular internet browsing via WIFI, chat, music, casual gaming, etc... I use it a lot. All in all a very solid phone for under 300$ you'll definitely not regret it.","2","Helpful"

That being said I went through not just the first phone in which even out of the box as soon as it turned on ran hot, hot enough to make me scared it was going to explode. Unfortunately I was leaving for a two week vacation and needed a phone for travel so as usual I thought let me push through I'm sure it'll be fine. At some point before even leaving for the airport the lens in the camera fell off but even before it did the pictures were horrible which shocker a camera company and they're slacking on this feature. The gps was intermediate as was the service. Now I can guess you'll say it was my carrier but my husbands phone an lg was just fine. The second phone same problems. Hate giving a bad review but for me to go out of my way to replace a phone is bad but twice? Sorry this is a fail. I got the huawei honor 5x for $185 and it is a way better deal and works flawlessly.

Mind you I did not use this feature. I do wish it had SWYPE but it did not. Also the color choices are amazing and very true to color. It comes with a matching semi transparent silicone case of matching color. Aswell as headphones, charger, screen protector etc...It is made of cheaper plastic and is very light weight in the hand.

I was so worried that it wouldn't since it was outdated and old, but it actually works just great!

"SONY XPERIA Z3 D6603 US LTE 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- Silver Green","","338","5","I'm late to the punch, but even at 6+ months old, this is an amazing phone with close to top-tier specs, a sleek design, and a surprisingly excellent UI. $500 for an unlocked phone of this caliber is an absolute bargain.First things first, my experience getting this activated: This is a GSM phone, meaning it will only function on AT&T or T-Mobile networks. Activation was as simple as getting a nano-sim from the AT&T store, then going into the ""Wireless Settings"" and selecting ""Internet Settings"" to do a quick download to set up the internet and MMS. That's it. Fully functioning phone, 4G, everything after that.Now to the phone itself:Pros:--Sleek design: It's slim with a premium look and feel, and I love the color options, as they offer a bit of variety--UI: The integration of Sony's baked-in UI with Lollipop is surprisingly great; much better than Samsung's clumsy and often bloated integration of TouchWiz. Not to say there isn't any bloatware, but a lot of it is camera effect plugins that can be disabled in the Apps menu. This is a true Android lover's phone, and probably the best implementation of Lollipop short of stock Android.--Camera: Even my 6-month old phone is the best available camera on the market today -- better than the Galaxy S6, better than the yet-to-be-released LG G4, better than iPhone. I also love that this is at no expense to design, as there is no protruding ""lip"" that causes your phone to sit uneven on a flat surface (a la iPhone 6 or Galaxy S6)--Hardware: The hardware, while admittedly not on par with iPhone 6 or GS6, is still plenty fast, having beaten out GS5 by a rather wide margin. It's not the fastest, but phones with top-tier specs are going to be overkill for the everyday user who isn't downloading 100 apps and doing hardware intensive gaming.--Extras: It seems like more and more phones are going away from the extra memory slot, but the Z3 still has it, and migrating files over is a cinch. The waterproof feature is a nice perk to have as well. But by far the best feature has to be the battery life. After a day of constant surfing, watching a few videos, and running chat apps, I'm over 80% some days.Cons:--Slippery: The sleek design comes at an ever-so-slight cost, as this phone will slip out of your hand if you don't keep a firm grip. Additionally, when setting it down somewhere, do not place it on anything smooth with even the slightest grade, as it will slide down (with ninja silence).--Accessories: Hard to fault the phone itself for this, but buying an unlocked phone that's not one of the top-sellers means most standard case and accessory shops won't carry equipment for it. Of course, there are plenty of options available online, but I'd rather be able to walk into a store and see how a case fits or how accessories work before buying.--Port covers: The charging port and the SD card/SIM card covers feel a bit flimsy. While this has not been an issue yet, I'm finding myself handling those very carefully because they seem like they can break off rather easily.Overall, a great phone at an unbeatable price. I've officially become a fan of Sony smartphones, and others seeking a change would be smart to at least give them a chance.**Update Edit: Wanted to add a few notes about a couple of features.1. There's a small plate with a couple of prongs on the left side of the phone. At first I had no idea what this did, but after some digging, I found out that it's a port for a MAGNETIC CHARGING CABLE. Caps because it's awesome. Really, I don't know why this feature isn't mentioned, well, anywhere, because it's high-tech, cool, and convenient, allowing you to charge your phone without having to remove the cover to the charging port (cable needs to be purchased separately). More smartphones need to have this feature.2. Took the phone abroad and, as advertised, using it in a different country (South Korea) was a cinch. Swapped out the SIM, updated internet settings, boom: working phone.3. For a slim, sleek transparent case that provides good protection without a lot of bulk, check out the Pasonomi transparent slim case here on Amazon, for which I also wrote a review.","2","Helpful"

When you go to charge the phone with this charger it says on the screen charger not compatible with this phone. When we took the phone to the local phone store sign up for service and they went to put the sim card in the card would go in too far and it made the phone read insert sim card when it was already in. So you have to tape the sim card at a certain point when inserting it so it reads properly. The worst part of this supposedly ""new"" phone is, the ringtone can not be heard at all!!

How ever for my complaints, It needs a better description of what the networks this phone will run 4g on and which ones it will not work on. Because as of right now they do not work on At&T's network for 4g...I'm currently running off of 2g. So I definitely feel with a better description I,or anyone else can base their decision to buy or not to buy, better if they added/fixed the description of the phone and it's capabilities.So to end this review if you don't mind not being on 4g networks, and want a cheap waterproof phone this is definitely the phone for you!","2","Helpful"

"Xgody S960 9.6"" Android 5.1 IPS Quad Core Dual SIM Unlocked 4G 3G Phablet Bluetooth 16GB","Shenzhen Xin Sheng Shang Technology Co.,Ltd","105","2","Read the google reviews before buying. I did not. There were not any amazon reviews when I bought this. The Xgody is unlocked, but could only get it to work on Edge network which is slower than a 4G and LTE. It came programed with Cingular as the access point name which is an old cell carrier company. With the help of AT&T support I updated the Access point name and info for AT&T as much as possible, but the APN type did not have an option to type in all of what was needed to be inputed. You could only check off boxes. Anyhow, having only the use of the Edge network made the internet speed very very slow. It would drop calls a lot too. At time the screen would just turn on or windows would bling on and off by itself, as well as not allowing the touch screen to open anything. Sometimes my Xgody would not turn off because the screen was not allowing the turn off screen icon to work when touched. Even when the screen was off and you turned the screen on sometimes it would not allow you to swipe it to unlock the screen. When you could get the screen to unlock, it sometimes randomly would not open up the applications for anything, even just the phone icon to make a call. The calls come out on speaker phone unless you use head phones or possibly a Bluetooth which I never tried. Sometimes the calls were clear and other times they were like you were taking to someone through an plastic bag. The phone takes a big SIM card instead of the more common smaller ones. AT&T switched mine out for free. There is a slot for an SD card which is important to me for games, and photos, but the phone was so glitchy, and the camera takes lower quality pictures compared to other camera phones on the market. The phone has a slot for a second SIM card for the phone to work internationally, but I never tried to use this feature. I wish the phone wasn't glitchy, and worked on a 4G network. I loved having the big screen.","2","Helpful"

I mean the screen is nice and clear and battery lasted a good while. Yes this is not that fast of a phone but it was fast enough for my needs.

"Globalstar GSP-1700 Handheld Satellite Phone, Silver","","350","1","The issues with Globalstar service are well documented, so I won't discuss them here. However I will say this is the most underwhelming piece of phone hardware I have seen in a long time, particularly since it cost $500. It is one thing to make a phone the just appears and feels cheap, but when people may be using this as a life saving device, there is no excuse to build a phone with parts that will fail so quickly and without warning. I purchased my phone a couple of years ago and immediately found the battery would charge, but within 3 days, with the phone off, the battery would completely discharge. Fortunately it was under warranty still so I was able to receive a new battery. This battery seemed to work fine initially. Because of the Globalstar service issues, I stopped using the phone, took the battery out, and put everything back in the box for about a year. I took everything out a few days ago to test it out again and found the battery would not fully charge. I let it discharge for a little while to see if it just needed to cycle, then I let it charge overnight, and in the morning the phone was completely dead. Would not power on at all, even with the AC adapter attached. Now I don't know if this is a battery issue again, or phone issue, or a charger issue. Regardless, this is not something I will ever rely on, or spend any money on to try and fix. This phone is essentially new in terms of usage, and now it is a doorstop. If I were Qualcomm I would be embarrassed to have my name emblazoned all over the front and on the battery itself. It is not good advertising for them.","2","Helpful"

The built-in flashlight is a life-saver at times. I took it out of the box with the battery registering at about 2/3 life and didn't charge it for over one week, having used the flashlight repeatedly, and talked for several hours on different days. After the first charge, it was at least 10 days of similar use before I had to charge it again.Only cons would have to do with assigning memory storage; I can't input as much calendar info as I need to. Also, I have only figured out how to assign one phone number per contact. The display is also very hard to read out in the sun.

"Sony Xperia Z C6603 Black Factory Unlocked LTE BANDS 1/3/5/7/8/20 International Version No Warranty - Original Sony phone","","179.99","2","The pros are basically that it's pretty cheap, runs the wonderful new version of Android, and still has pretty respectable specs. I doubt most people straight up need their mobile to have the processing and graphics power of a decent laptop.The cons are pretty annoying, though, and I'm replacing it once I get enough spare money to justify:- It's hot. Very hot. If all the functions are enabled it can start running hot enough to (very mildly) burn you if you touch the top for too long, and the heat is so bad that it is literally cracking its own backplate- The SIM loading method involves using a small paper/plastic tray as an interface. The directions on this are pretty easy to ignore and the tray looks like a placeholder for the actual SIM, so many/most people throw it away. This makes it very hard to get a SIM out once it's in and stops many SIMs from working well. You can get replacement trays, but compared to the ZL (push in to put it in, push further in to release) it's pretty inconvenient, especially if you travel internationally or change carriers at some point.- Randomly gets caught in a continuously loop of restarts, possibly because of the overheating issue.- Terrible battery life even with stamina on if it's hot, which happens a lot because of the overheating issue- Slippery backplate (contrast to the ZL which has a textured rubber surface) makes it harder to hold ontoIf you're going for a phone in this range I'd shell out the extra $50 and get the ZL, honestly. I'm upgrading to the most recent version as soon as finances permit, this is very much a temp.","2","Helpful"

Very nice and unlike my old audiovox, I can see what time it is anytime I look at it without having to wait for the Verizon logo to change back over to the time. Being able to take pictures gives you SO much more choices for phone backgrounds. Right now my background is a unicorn picture that I had saved on my computer. ^_^ Below are what I think are the phone's pros and cons since I find pros and cons to be so helpful when I am shopping online.PROS:--great reliable Verizon reception--great call quality (no distorted or dropped phone calls)--ringer is quite loud (both the preloaded AND the downloaded and I don't have it on the highest setting)--camera takes pretty good pictures if it's main purpose is to take small pictures to send to friends & others or set as a phone background--battery life is good (the battery display is a little misleading (it says it's lower than it really is) but rest assured that you're good to go until it starts blinking)--display screen is bright and colorful and clear and the verizon logo doesn't take up half the screen and cut off the tops of my pictures like on my old audiovox--the phone is very nice looking and conveniently small (bigger than my old audiovox but currently the smallest phone availible from VerizonCONS:--no speakerphone!!! i haven't missed this feature yet but some people might really rely on this.--some features take some playing around time or manual reading to figure out (like how to change the txt msg ringer or set the phone to vibrate) of course if you always read your manual before using something than this isn't a problem for you.--no stopwatch feature like on my old audiovox. (you may not care about this, I haven't missed this feature, but I did like having it.--you can't turn the shutter sound off on the phone. This doesn't bother me, but it may bother some. You can change it to something else. Mine chimes and I hardly even notice it, but I like that it makes a sound so I know that the picture took.--no preloaded games but what phone comes with preloaded games these days except maybe nokia--the 15 preloaded ringtones are not the best, but I hardly ever use those anyway and the ones I do use I actually like for the purpose they serve (like txt msg alert)--the vibrate feature on the phone is not very strong which I like but some people like an electric-like shock to hit them when their phone goes off*This is the fourth cell phone I owned and I love this one the best.

I thought to try and swap out the USB, and what do you know - it charges with no issue!Now, this phone.... I understand to try and release new phone model, but why did you call it Zenfone 2, Asus!? The flash on the back is moved, proximity sensor and front camera is also moved compare to Zenfone 2. None of the cases and screen protectors for Zenfone 2 will work with this phone, you have to look for them saying Zenfone 2 Laser.

That being said, I did the initial set-up of the phone, including the installation of a few apps, and customizing the ring tones etc.Based on other reviews indicating some black models had a defect, I purchased the white model. 1/ My first and possibly only disappointment was a requirement stated on the box that for international users (such as me) the phone may need to be initialized with a US spec SIM card. Of course, I discovered this when I unboxed it outside the US. 2/ That is also when I discovered that it uses a mini-SIM as opposed to the full-size SIM that I've grown accustomed to. I don't think these issues were stated in the product description, but they proved to be non-issues in the end. Our service provider (Digicel-Jamaica) cut the SIM card down to size basically for free.From setting up the phone and otherwise using it a few times, the phone feels fairly light, and the size isn't overwhelming - I like a phone size that allows me to operate it with one hand. This is facilitated by its fairly narrow width. Functionally, navigation feels smooth. I haven't used it in daylight much, but from memory the screen was sufficiently bright.Most of whatever else you want to know is covered in the specs and is discussed by other users. I love the performance, but most phones feel good when new, and start showing their true (weaker) capabilities after a few months use. No complaints so far. I'm satisfied enough that I'm thinking of upgrading from my S3 Mini to this exact model in the near future.I purchased the package with screen protector and full body case. Both fit perfectly out of the box, and allow full functionality.","2","Helpful"

"Apple iPhone 5 64GB - Unlocked GSM Smartphone - Black (Certified Refurbished)","","249.98","4","This phone so far has been pretty good, I know its refurbished and all but it works fine! The only downside I would say is that it didn't come with the little pick to put the sim card in, and after about the third day of having it, it completely froze. I don't know why, it just did, the screen would not shut off or lock, it just froze right on the app that I was using. So I left it alone for about an hour and it went back to normal. As of that day nothing else has gone wrong with it. The battery life works very well. It came earlier than expected, and in very good condition, looks just like new. Only that it did not come in the apple iphone box, it came in just a normal box with an iphone charger and the wall charger adapter. But I am almost certain that this charger isn't from apple itself, pretty sure it is just a white charger you can buy from the gas station, but it still works perfectly fine. This is honestly a great phone, if you don't mind it's version. I know the iphone 7 is about to come out, but this one works great too! I would definitely recommend this to someone who doesn't care about what version iphone they have. I mean for 239$ for 64GB I think is an extremely good deal.","2","Helpful"

"Moto Z Play + Hasselblad Camera Mod","","699.98","5","Just like another reviewer my LG V10 went into bootloop failure. It was a great phone until catastrophe struck. Being a power user I immediately began the hunt for a phone with a replaceable battery. I'm on my phone all day and don't have access to a charger. I quickly learned that this little gem was being lauded for it's great battery life and even better, the ability to attach a power pack. I was hesitant because it's suppose to be a mid-range phone.So far the phone has been pretty amazing. Going rstraight from a V10 you do notice the phone just slightly slower and you can notice the screen is less sharp because of the lower resolution. After 3 or 4 days you completely forget these things though mostly because the phone is buttery smooth and the Amoled display is so much better than LCD at displaying colors and brightness. The phone handles everything I throw at it without a hiccup. I mean it is smooth. It just feels so efficient and well optimized. The battery life will probably send this phone into the realms of android lore for a long time. Using it full blast it stills last ALL freaking day, absolutely amazing.It's almost pure android and this was a big issue for me. LG offers a ton customization which stock android doesn't . I still can't believe that you can't customize the Nav bar soft buttons, really google? I ended using a gesture program to get around this. I really wish the camera was better. It would have made this phone a true monster. As it is, it's still an amazing piece of hardware. It goes to show that sometimes taking a step back, lower resolution, slower processor can lead to a better experience.","2","Helpful"

If you plan on using for much storage, I recommend adding memory (think it's a microSD slot, but check the specs).Pros: Love the size, pocket-size. Works great with Audible audiobooks & Overdrive audiobooks (from public library). Large speaker on backside great for audiobooks & music (must use with speaker face-up though). It was very easy to USB device to PC & copy music over. Has headphone jack. Comes with earbuds, USB charger, & USB cable.Cons: Need to use stylus for detailed clicking, not recommended for browsing.

I (of course... probably the same as you...) had never heard of the name brand ""Juning"" for a cell phone. When I looked to see if it was compatible with what service plans we use... I quickly learned that it is compatible with many (probably all!) I have ""Straight Talk"" and so do the other members of our family... Where we live the towers are sparse?? We only have verison towers I was told... Now... that is important to note right there... because YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE TOWERS ARE IN YOUR AREA... (or the area you will be most using this phone.) If it's AT&T... you need to use the AT&T sims card... Verizon is another option... and then there are 2 others... (I'm old... I haven't had my coffee... I can't think of the other towers... LOL...) When we got the ""bring your phone to straight talk"" kit ($69.00 or something like that.) it comes with the 4 sims cards... and instructions... as well as the $45.00 phone minutes card for one month of service. We were trying to change my sons old phone to the new one... the woman who worked there had a hard time doing it (But she was VERY impressed with the phone and the fact it had ""Dual"" sims cards... a space for 2 memory cards (or something...LOL...) So know that... She was also very jealous of the price and the quality and played with it for quite awhile! She said SHE would be looking for one herself! Ok... So since she sets phones up for a living in our area... (though not this brand.) we listened to her advice. She said even though we have Verizon towers... we would need to use the AT&T card. (this didn't compute well in my brain. It makes no sense. I am still unsure why we were told that.) We spent about an hour with her and she was unable to set it up (legally.... She said the store would not let her touch a phone that we did not purchase there. That makes perfect sense.) but after telling us the steps we needed to take to do it ourselves... we were sure we could handle it. We did... we got home and set the card up (the most issue we had was with straight talk itself.... we couldn't get working WIFI on it... keep in mind... the phone itself works fine... and when we are at home on OUR Wifi... it works wonderful. The person who we called at the ""Straight talk"" number had a difficult time and kept going through the steps... She isn't in our area... and I am not sure she knows what towers are being used in our rural little community... Like I said... we keep being told that Verizon towers are the local towers... but for some reason we have 2 women telling us to use the AT&T Card. We think this is what is effecting the WIFI signal... the phone service goes in and out (depending on our location...) I can call my son and have him sitting 3 feet away... my phone will call his... and when he goes to dial me... he will get my voice mail. But I think thats all on straight talks end and the Cell towers. The phone itself is very nice. You have a good sound quality... He is able to take nice pictures. He picked the Gold color... it looks very very nice... High end and expensive looking...He loves it... He says he will try to install the other sims card to see what kind of luck he has with it. I did receive this with a coupon for my honest review of the phone... This is my honest review.","3","Helpful"

Love the S7 Edge though. This dual SIM version wouldn't handle the two carriers cellular data properly. Once on wi-fi it would rarely transition to cell data without a reboot. Even then it didn't like two SIMs from different carriers. Suspect it is meant for two SIMs from the same carrier only. If I inserted a single SIM only, it worked better, but oddly my TMo SIM only got less than 1Mbps on band 12 LTE when the same SIM in a different phone pulled 15+Mbps consistently. ATT speeds when only 1 SIM inserted were consistent with other phones. If I can only use one SIM I might as well buy a single SIM US version so that wi-fi calling and VoLTE could work too, which they don't on this international version.Beyond the dual SIM issues, the Galaxy S7 Edge was a great phone. Awesome camera. Nice display.","3","Helpful"

This phone actually looks nicer in real than online. It's unlocked, and I'm outside the US, and it was quite easy, I just slip in the sim and it worked perfectly with the local network.

I will say, it syncs with bluetooth and can receive calls no problem, but the software with which you need to install to receive notifications is a battery drainer on my phone. Also, it doesn't work.

"BLU Selfie Global GSM - Unlocked (Blue)","BLU","169.99","4","I really wanted to love this phone. However, it was not the phone for me. For three very specific reasons:1. No LTE. I don't really care about this, but where I live is really remote and I didn't realize how much having LTE made a difference for getting service in my house. After switching to this from an HTC One M8 with 4G LTE, I had service maybe 20% of the time at my house. However, it was great absolutely anywhere else - out shopping, friend's house, work, etc. Just not my home.2. Speakers (or lack thereof). The phone has one speaker located on the back of the phone. This makes it near impossible to listen to music or watch videos if you lay the phone on its back. It also makes it difficult to use the phone as a GPS as you will not be able to hear it if it is in a hands free holder or anything in your car.3. Lack of support for embedded videos. I don't know why, but if I tried to watch any video that was embedded into a website (say a news report on a news site) the video would play without audio. However, if the video had a link to YouTube, vimeo, or some other site where it was directly uploaded, the video would play with audio on the site it was hosted on directly. I watch a lot of videos so I grew increasingly frustrated with the inability to play them with audio.Again, these are the only reasons I am returning this phone. The cameras are great, the battery is on par or better than some of the other smart phones I've owned, images and video are crisp and clear (sometimes an occassional lag but nothing worth getting upset over). These three things are just important to me and if BLU could create a Selfie 2.0 that fixed these problems, I would buy it instantly.","3","Helpful"

I tried to buy a temporary Blue Studio phone and the camer sucked, was chunky whereas this is large and slim profile without being flimsy. Comes with a protective case which i find thoughtful.

(Model#: X511 BLUE)","Posh Mobile","69.99","5","While I've only had this a few days, so far it's far better than I expected. A few notes about some issues users report.1. The phone as of 2016-05-18 did NOT work on metropcs, so save your time, at least not in my area. T-Mobile and ATT are fine. I believe some of the entries on amazon say it works on metropcs, that's incorrect. It will work on any network that accepts unlocked GSM phones.2. The usb charger is not hard to work around, all you have to do is take a standard length microusb plug, take a hardware store razor blade, and slice away at an angle from the plastic connector down to the metal part, it's really not difficult, and there's no need to worry about having the slightly longer included cable, I just cut away at about a 45 degree angle and a standard cable fit fine. The case is at a slight angle where the connector meets the body, so that side can be cut away slightly more than the other. Without this cable mod, the connection was erratic using a standard usb cable, with it, it's fine.3. Standby battery life is quite good, but when you use it for anything, the battery drains fast, but that's why it only weighs 52 grams, you can't expect a tiny battery to have a long life, that's not realistic.This little phone is amazing, they've actually managed to cram a full android smart phone onto the device. Typing on it is delicate since the key icons are so tiny, but you actually get the hang of it unless you have thicker fingers.In terms of size, this phone is literally about the same size as just the top lid part of an old flip phone I have.I can't think of a better phone for things like backpacking where you need to have a phone for rides etc, and for me, I prefer this small size, I almost never carry my full sized smart phone because I just don't like that size.I won't know for a year how durable this thing actually is, but honestly, at the price, I don't even care if it fails, you can buy 12 of these for every galaxy or iphone you buy, and they aren't nearly as adorable.","3","Helpful"

"LG Nexus 5 D820 Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Android Smartphone 32GB - Black","Google","489","5","An awesome phone for an awesome price. At first I had to get used to the size, but that only took a few days. After looking at a few reviews online, two of the downsides to this phone were described to be low volume (when settings are highest) and a relatively short battery life. In my opinion, the volume is just fine. It doesn't have to be superloud in order for you to hear the alarm or your ringtone. The fact that the speakers are on the down side of the phone (instead of the back), ensures the sound is not muffled when putting down your phone either back or front side. The second point, the battery life, was my primary concern. I was a little disappointed in the battery life during the first couple of days, but the battery life somehow increased after charging it a few times (maybe also a bit of overcharging during the night). Right now, the battery life is perfect for me. I am not that heavy of a user (texting, browsing online, Facebook,, making pictures, a few calls a day and occasionally a game or a video), so sometimes I end up having more than 30% battery life left when I go to sleep. I am happy with the 32GB version, although I am nowhere near using half of it. Because there is no way to expand the storage capacity and I intend to use the phone for at least 2 years, I went for the 32GB. I have an iPod, so I so not store my music on this phone which saves me loads of space, and so the 16GB might have been enough.Last but not least, the camera is pretty good/decent. Make sure you always have HDR+ on to get better quality. I know there are some phones out there that have better cameras and I would say that this one is about good to average. Make sure you buy a casing that protects the camera. Naked, the phone has the camera sticking out from the back, so it can easily get damaged when you put it down.All in all, a really good phone! I am very content with it and would recommend this phone to anyone.","4","Helpful"

I bought this because I wanted a waterproof phone I could use and it had ps4 remote play which was a plus. The camera isn't as clear as I thought it would be but its still pretty decent. I also had a good experience with my first Sony smart phone. It was Sony Ericsson then but that phone lasted me a long while. Here's to hoping this will also be the same.Notes:-When the phone first came, you will experience opening this phone and realize that it starts out in the Chinese/Taiwanese language. If you just keep hitting next on your screen it'll take you to the home screen eventually where you can go to the app home > settings > find language and hit the first topmost tab. If you get to this point correctly what follows next is a pop up with langauges to select. English is listed in there or whatever else language one speaks. There was a lot. So in other words, there is a way to get english language on this phone.-My setup is T-Mobile with LTE/4G. So far I can make calls and text messages.-This phone indeed has a fingerprint sensor-It is supposedly waterproof. I haven't tested it.-It can Remote Play with your Playstation if you have one.Edit: 9-1-16BTW My data plan with T-mobile is 4G/LTE and it works as long as you follow the steps to this video:[...](this is not me btw, I just luckily found this on the web), And right now everything works perfectly. The video helps so people should keep note especially if you got the same Taiwanese International version that I got. See video.","4","Helpful"

"Sony Ericsson K790a Phone (Unlocked)","Sony Ericsson Mobile","26.5","5","I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phone I have ever owned. It has also replaced my camera, and I am now never without a camera.I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited. They don't give the phone a second glance, not realizing it's got the 3.2 megapixel capability. I have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows.After throwing in a 1GB memory stick (I think it was $79?) it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300+ pics right now.The movie function rocks too, however you are going to want to be up very close to the subject. The sound playback of the movies is fantastic though, so at least concert videos make for good listening.The phone works flawlessly with my PC. If I throw it on the USB cable, it pops up instantly as another drive, just like the camera. Just drag on/off the music and pics. All pics are very nicely numbered and named.If I don't care about viewing the files and just want to move stuff on and off the phone, I don't even take it out of my pocket. The bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move things around.Also very cool was that it pops up on my computer as a Modem, which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC Anywhere program.In terms of being a phone, yeah it's great. The contact list is easy to work with, the call clarity is no issue at all, good signal, no dropped calls, etc. etc. (this is all with Cingular). Speaker phone works well.It needs charging about every 3rd day, charges very quickly. Charges slower but with the USB plugged in it also charges.The only thing I can think to complain about is that when using the USB cable to charge, it only wants to charge it to 89%. If I want 100% I have to throw it on the real charger for a few minutes.","4","Helpful"

It was an unlocked Verizon phone that I could use on Straight Talk for Verizon Networks. It came quickly, the price was great ($299 refurbished) and looked brand new with all of the OEM accessories. Because I was using Verzion, I had to get a special LTE sim card for the phone in order to get LTE service (which works great). If you have Straight Talk send it to you, its free or if you are impatient, you can buy it as a bundle to your monthly service for @ $5.00 extra from any local big box store. I personally like free, so I waited. The hardest part of the purchase was dealing with customer no services to get the porting transfer complete. After that it was easy.

The box comes with one cord & a charging plug for the home and car.

I heard reports that now happens on Nexus phones as well)- Google Home/ChromecastThings that don't work in EUI 5.8.016S (stable):- Smart Unlock (either with location or USB device; when I tap on a notification I get to the app that sent it, but when I swipe up it just always shows the unlock screen)- The Camera app has low motion video, but no Photosphere or HDR. I was able to install the Marshmallow Camera app from ApkMirror and I now can make Photospheres or take HDR pics, but the video mode crashes. So, you need both apps, which is a bit cumbersome. I attached a photo taken with the phone.- The Google Contacts app. It crashed the Dialer and I had to switch back to the EUI Contacts app.- more to come1 month update: I upgraded to the EUI 5.8.019s (stock Chinese ROM) without any problems. The limitations described above remained the same, but I do now have a ""System Update"" app in Settings that wasn't there previously. Smart unlock now works occasionally (by location when I am in the office, but not when I am at home for some reason). It will make future updates a bit easier.","4","Helpful"

I still reach for my back button lol. I just wanted a phone that is reliable and doesn't glitch out... and for some reason I wasn't impressed by the edge screens on the new flagship Galaxy phones. I figured it would be a good time to buy an iPhone since the release of the iPhone 7 caused the price to drop on older models.With iOS 10 installed, I don't feel like I'm wanting to instantly go back to my android. The display is beautiful even compared to the super amoled displays on other phones. They are both gorgeous in their own ways, and the 6+ is still very bright, colorful, and crisp. Everything is very fluid, beautiful to navigate, and the apps are so nice to look at! This phone just works.

If you are a vocaloid fan, you should really consider getting this phone. I would just like to say this though. I had used Verizon for quite some time but when I got this phone and did some looking into different networks and how they work I realized that Verizon uses very unique technology and after talking to their tech support for quite awhile we concluded that the technology they use is too different from the rest of the world to get this phone functioning on their network. However, I took it to AT&T (as they use a network much more similar to the rest of the world than Verizon) and it worked beautifully. Talk, text and wifi all worked great with just putting in a SIM card. In order to get the over the air internet (3G) working I had to set up an APN on the phone for AT&T's network (you can google the settings real easy).I thought about giving it 4 stars for not working with Verizon, but then realized that I can't take any credit away from this phone for being incompatible with a network that is different from pretty much ever other network in the world. 5 stars from me.","4","Helpful"

I have a lot of experience buying smartphones. Not just iphones, samsungs, and LGs. I have owned several BLU brand phones, ZTE, DOOGEE, and others. Sure this phone might not have the specs of the $700 phones. But I'll tell you what though this phone looks just as good or better than the over-priced market dominators. Its has a clean sleek design for a BIG screen that's bright and sharp and runs fast.My daughter had a galaxy s5 that was having troubles switching between sim carriers and was quite disgruntled over the thought of being forced by cost-conscious Dad's mandate for something affordable like Mom's BLU phone. She had suffered through too many of Dad's iPhone screen replacements that had about 75% chance of going well, so we were both a little nervous about this purchase...When the Padgene Hotknot arrived, she immediately liked it so much she actually started jumping up and down like she was 12 again. The package came with 2 NICE EXTRA PROTECTIVE CASES AND A NICE STURDY ADHESIVE PROTECTIVE SHIELD!! Out of maybe 50 phones I've unboxed in my lifetime, none have ever came with such generous accessories.If there is one drawback to this phone - my daughter says the front camera is not as good as the galaxy for her many selfies. But she was quick to say she didn't even care because everything else was so awesome.In my opinion this is a better phone than pretty much most of the $250 unlocked 4G phones on the market. But if you like lighting cigars with $100 bills - you should stay with Apple or Samsung.","4","Helpful"

James here with Review This! Today I am reviewing the IPRO Unlocked Wave 4.0 cell phone.**Disclaimer** This is not a flagship killer phone. It is not the top of the line phone on the market. It is a budget phone. With that in mind, here is my review.Now that I have that out of the way, I want to say that I am very impressed with this phones quality for its price.I use a carrier that uses sim cards. So if I break my phone, I can simply take my sim card out and put it into this phone as a temporary replacement till I get my new one. It is only 3G capable, so don't get your hopes up of watching high definition videos while using your cell carrier.This phone has a slower processor, as well as slower gpu, so even though the battery is a small 1500Mah battery, it is plenty to last you all day. The screen size is perfect for smaller hands, and is very comfortable to use. This phone also feels very good to hold. It does feel a little cheap on the build quality, but for the price, I believe this phone is a steal. A computer in your pocket for under $40 with no contract! Nasa sent man to the moon with a room full of equipment that is only a fraction of the power this small phone has!It is running android, so you can access the play store for games and multimedia, the speaker in the phone actually sounds pretty good. So listening to movies or music is a delight.It is running a stock android. No bloatware, or unwanted apps to slow down the phone.This phone comes recommended by Review This! as a temporary replacement phone, a phone for a older person who does not need or want a whole lot, but still wants a smart phone(you can enable accessibility under settings to make it easier to read the screen), or for a kids first phone. This is a great value for the price!**I received this product at a discount or for free for an unbiased and honest review. I have reviewed this item honestly and thoroughly.

"SanDisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC UHS-I Card with Adapter","","64.98","3","As someone who just wants a good *small phone*, for making phone calls, I found myself buying this one because it was literally the only small phone I could find (the phone I replaced was a bar phone the size of a Chicklets box). Every other option available now is either a smart phone or cheap flip-phone garbage.So I chose this phone entirely for its size, not because it's a smart phone (keyboard way too small to type on), and I was very pleasantly surprised at the call quality on the handset and when using bluetooth. I *DO* recommend this phone if you just want something small for making calls, but don't get your hopes up.Having said that, you get what you pay for:- The pictures provided by the manufacturer are *very* misleading, showing a standard Android Launcher screen, when in fact this phone has a cheap, custom UX that tries and fails to look like iOS.- For no discernible reason, this custom UI doesn't use Android standards ΓÇö for exampleΓÇª - There is no Apps Tray, and instead all your apps are on your homescreen whether you like it or not - It has a Recent Apps button, but it's inexplicably used for Settings instead - Recent Apps is instead found only by holding down the Home button- The paltry user guide has *no* instructions of any kind about this nonsense custom UI, so you're completely on your own for figuring out stuff like how to reach Recent Apps, so good luck figuring out how to add widgets or rearrange the home screens (tap and hold on empty spot of Launcher)- Instead of using the perfectly fine Android Contacts app, there's a custom contacts app that leaves a lot to be desired- You can't edit or delete Contacts stored on your SIM card (but you can add new SIM contacts) - (You'll have to download ""SIM Contacts"" by PenumbraApps from Play Store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.penumbra.apps.SIM_Contacts_Manager- The maximum volume on the handset isn't loud enough- The maximum volume on the speakerphone *really, really* isn't loud enough- You can't change lock screen background to pic ΓÇö you're stuck with what they give you- Because of screen size, keyboard is nearly impossible to type on - Download ""TouchPal,"" which is a) the best keyboard for Android anyway, b) allows you to resize it (I can type on this one)- Status bar shows mobile & wifi signal strength, but *doesn't show bluetooth status* (again, silly custom UI) - However, there is a Power Control widget you can put on the home screen for that- The battery monitor is wildly inaccurate- If you keep your phone numbers on your SIM, the Direct Dial widget thinks *every* phone number is a mobile phone, and you can't change it- The accelerometer is sketchy ΓÇö when pulling phone down from face during call, screen comes on only about 1/10th of the time - Worse, power button doesn't start up the screen during calls about 60% of the time eitherIf anyone else made decent small feature phones anymore, I probably wouldn't have even looked at this one. But if you want a small phone with decent call quality, you're pretty much stuck with this.","5","Helpful"

This thing is a dream compared to other phones that can barely make it a full day, if that. There are times when under regular use I still have 75% at 5 pm when the device was at 100% at 8:00 am. Mind you this is after optimizing apps to run efficiently but still, it's top tier.2. Build Quality. I was concerned about this as some past Cat phones didn't stand up too well in endurance tests, at least as presented by tests on YouTube. However, the quality of the components is very good. Wouldn't feel bad about dropping this phone. Also the latches on this device are solid, unlike those on some Sony Xperia products. I was concerned about the rear latch opening accidentally under wet conditions but it actually takes some effort to slide the trigger to the side.3. Waterproof. 2 meters and 5 meters if you close off the speakers is a welcomed feature if you're traversing very deep streams.4. Android. Near stock Marshmallow. Aside from Nexus and Moto devices, this qualifies as one of the cleanest installs. There are a few extra apps, but some of them have a purpose, such as the one to clear wet speakers. I was able to either uninstall or inactivate any apps I didn't want to use.5. Custom button. There is an orange button on the left side of the device that you can program to do any desired function. Actually make that functions. For example, it allows for a dual setup of launching a different process or app depending if you short press or long press the button.Negatives1. Camera. The conventional camera is okay but not great. I found it most lacking in low light conditions with grain and a confused auto-focus. Also the stock camera app doesn't allow for true manual mode.2. Display. The display is a lower resolution LCD. Although definitely as great as an OLED Samsung display, it's not bad, but this may matter to some. However, the size is perfect, especially given the extra thickness of the device over conventional phones.In short this is a great device for outdoorsy types or those who work in a demanding environment but likely will not appeal to the general public, which is okay. It does not have the splendid display or a high end Samsung device or the camera but it does deliver on almost everything else. The FLIR camera is a nice bonus if you use it, and it has some practical applications, for example I was able to see the cold vs. hot pipes running the length of our ceiling so may be of benefit to contractors.","5","Helpful"

The camera is interpolated from 2.3MP up to 5 and does not focus, which is expected for the price point.

The phone doesn't get hot from charging or use, and yet it is not slow compared to other similar phones with the same 1GHz chipset. The one and only thing that is lacking is the flashlight; it is the most dim flashlight I've ever seen on any phone, but it's still helpful in pure darkness and with video.(side note) One out of 2 ordered came with a small black half-circle on the right side of the screen and, when it was pressed just to put the phone in its case the screen cracked from the inside.

Did not need or want to carry around what's basically a $300 computer with a 5 inch screen. Nor do I want to pay for a data plan. This is WiFi enabled so I can still get online if my tablet isn't handy.Had to download a T9 keyboard. I was used to that format and the screen is too small to use the qwerty without a stylus. Texting at the same speed as my old flip.Others have noted that it needs an extended (8mm) tip micro usb cable.The sim size is MICRO. That's the middle size between nano and mini that are used in cell phones. I had to order an adapter. Seems crazy that the Poshmobile.com site lists the sim card size as ""regular"".

I love that seller.>>> Came with a complimentary Silicone Case>>> 2 Screen Protectors>>> Brand new sealed Apple Earbuds w/ track control>>> The whole deal looked like someone opened the box, didn't like the phone and returned it. Seller was highly professional.Unfortunately the iPhone was locked to T-mobile, and not Carrier unlocked but when i received my phone the seller had already Boot-unlocked the device. I made some mistakes and needed to factory-reset my phone and realized I need a Nano Sim to Boot-unlock.I now leave a NEW Unactivated T-mobile Nano Sim inside the SIM tray of the Phone in case I ever need to Factory Reset again in the future.>>>> if I don't boot-unlock, the phone will be Stuck at the ""Hello!"" screen and just after Wifi Selection.>>> After Boot-unlock remove the Nano Sim and reset. (Exception is if the Nano Sim has 4G prepaid cellular service). Otherwise the Phone will be stuck in a look trying to get 4G cellular signal.>>> Others recommended using a old/used deactivated Nano Sim , but I got a new one in case I ever needed to activate a ""Prepaid Plan"".I really love the Apple iPhone, the design is great, pretty much everything Apple advertises is in the phone with no gimmicks.Again I mainly got this as a media player because Apple iTunes suit all my needs.

During a large update it would probably shut down or burn out. At the least the life of the phone would be cut way short from the overheating.

"Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)","Nokia","193.5","5","Prior to purchasing the E71, I had the iPhone 3G. Granted the user-interface and touch response of the iPhone is great but I honestly prefer the E71 over the iPhone. Here are my reasons why:- You maybe wondering, why would someone downgrade from an iPhone 3G to Nokia E71 (2008 phone)? Simply because the E71 cuts all the unnecessary garbage and is just GREAT for making and receiving calls, checking e-mails (work, school and personal), maps/directions, music, calendar, contacts, slim form-factor, long battery life and most importantly, it's MADE IN FINLAND!- DESIGN: It's sleek and solid. Very well built and feels good in your hands. Metal backing and overall, looks very classy!- MUSIC: E71 is expandable via micro-SD. Invested in a 8GB micro-SD card (Class 6), transferred my music, purchased a 2.5mm to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter, bought a Fiio Headphone Amplifier and you've got yourself a high-quality portable MP3 player AND you can answer calls, browse the internet and check e-mails.- MAPS: Ovi Maps (offers voice-guided directions) and Google Maps are both great! One feature I absolutely LOVED about Google Maps for E71 was the voice-recognition feature. Press the TALK button and say the name of your destination (ex. XYZ Drycleaners), I was blown away by its accurracy - it actually works flawlessly! With Ovi Maps, you can download maps from different countries. I'll be traveling to India this summer and the idea/concept of having the map of India for point-to-point direction is just phenomenal.- KEYBOARD - Now I'm back to using a physical QWERTY keyboard but the layout is great. Well placed, raised keys. After a week or so, you'll get familiar and will be typing at a good speed.- SCREEN/MENU: Great resolution, brightness. Adjustable menus, icons, apps etc. The layout of the menus and options is simple and straightforward. Won't even need to look at the manual, it's user-friendly.- It's got VIDEO CHAT facility with a front-facing camera.- It's got an FM Radio which works great!Overall, if you're looking for a phone that DOES THE JOB and DOES IT EFFECTIVELY and EFFICIENTLY, go with this phone. Sound quality and clarity is great. I can go for 2 days EASY without having to charge the phone. If you're looking for a multimedia device, iPhone is your best bet. However, I've successfully been able to use pretty much all the features I used on my iPhone - maps (Ovi maps and Google Maps), E-mail, Shazam, Calendar, Facebook, Skype. I have the E71-2 North American Unlocked version. In other words, this is a WORLD phone! :) I've received several compliments on this phone in the past month that I've owned it. It differentiates you from the rest of the people with Blackberry's, iPhones, HTC's etc. No one can ever tell that it's a 2008 phone!Not really CONS but I'll say drawbacks:- no thread feature for text messaging- browsing the internet can be time consuming/cumbersome - but I don't usually surf the net on a mobile device that much anyway - (whether iPhone or E71)","5","Helpful"

"Apple iPhone 6S, Rose Gold, 16GB, AT&T","","649.98","2","When I first received the iPhone I was a bit upset. It seemed to state the item was in great condition but when I received it there were many scratches and dents on the phone. Another frustrating thing was that it had not been previously factory restored so it had a pass code and blah blah and I needed to go through and reset everything on my own. Which isn't a huge deal. I contacted the seller who offered a $50 refund which was accepted. That was awesome of them to do! I am now however noticing that something isn't quite right with the screen. Originally I thought it was the wallpaper since I've never had an iPhone before. But it looks like it has some sort of either puncture or water damage that distorts the screen a bit. I reached out to the company and never heard anything. Disappointing considering this was a pretty big purchase.","5","Helpful"

"Huawei Honor X2 7.0 inch Android 5.0 Phablet Phone Octa Core RAM 3GB ROM 16GB Dual SIM (Standard)","XJKJ","223.99","5","To give a timeline on how long the shipping took, I ordered the phone on Sunday, 6/7. The phone shipped out on 6/10. I finally received the phone 6/23. It was being shipped for USPS by a 3rd party carrier up until the time of delivery which was USPS. The shipping was free so I canΓÇÖt complain. The phone itself is excellent!!! The screen is sharp and clear. The phone I received was unlocked. The issue I had was that it would not let me update the ROM. For the phone you are supposed to go to settings/updater ΓÇô choose MENU and search for updates. My phone didnΓÇÖt have the ΓÇ£search for updatesΓÇ¥. I download the next update ROM from HuaweiΓÇÖs website, copied it onto my SDCARD in the phone, powered down the phone, held the power button while holding the volume up and volume down at the same time, released the power button when the HONOR logo appeared but keep the volume up and down pressed until the EMUI logo appeared and it then started loading the new software/ROM. After that completed I went into settings/updater/check for updates. There was an OTA update available which I loaded. My initial ROM was B009 and I updated to B012 then took the on-the-air update to B013. Oh, when I went to the B012 update it was missing the GAPPS but I was able to load it from the Huawei icon on the phone for their equivalent of Google Playstore. I have T-Mobile and the phone picks up on HSPA+ with no problem. I also have rooted the phone following the instructions from XDA developers. The rooting with this phone does not interfere with any OTA updates as I rooted it when it was on BO12 rom and took an OTA update to B013. The phone is well worth the money and I have shown it to many co-workers who will also be purchasing the phone.","6","Helpful"

It's truly a phone, not a phablet- Fingerprint unlock works very well- Best of all, so far all the 50+ migrated apps work.Cons- No Iris scan support or eye-friendly nighttime color mode (things I miss from Note 7)- No native WiFi calling support.

"Getnord Walrus Rugged Waterproof IP68 Cell Phone. Works in AT&T, T-Mobile and other US GSM networks.","Getnord","79","1","I was excited when my Walrus arrived but there are some quirks about it that I wish I had known before I purchased.Less than two weeks after I received it the phone began to malfunction. I contacted seller who advised me to return it.Because of the need for special cables and the limitations on contact names I decided not to replace it.Some things I wish I had known before purcasing the Walrus:1. It uses a 8-9mm long micro USB connector plug with a slim profile. None of my other micro USB cables will work with the Walrus because their plugs are the 5-6mm long plug which is too short to connect. My car charger won't work either. The Walrus came with one USB cable so that one cable is the only one I have to either charge it or connect it to the computer. Any micro USB connector with a long plug also has to have a slim profile because the USB and headphone jacks are recessed into the case on the Walrus.2. It uses a 3.5mm headphone jack that is 17mm long. The Walrus comes with a pair of earbuds but they aren't very comfortable or have great sound. All of my other 3.5mm headphone jacks have the 14mm long TRRS plug which is standard here in the USA, so none of them are compatible with the Walrus including my favorite noise-cancelling ear buds that cost more than the Walrus. Again, any 3.5mm plug will also have to be slim profile to fit into the jack which is recessed into the Walrus case.3. It won't send or receive pictures via SMS text message. The only options to get pictures off the phone are via Bluetooth or USB. If someone sends you a text message with a picture you get the text but not the picture. This is a huge disappointment to me because sometimes a picture IS worth a thousand words - maybe more when you are entering text on a numeric keypad without predictive text or trying to describe something by voice to someone who isn't familiar with the subject.4. The Contacts are limited to 20 characters for the name and 40 digits for the phone number. That's it. One field for name which will take up to twenty letters, numbers, or symbols. One field for the phone number up to 40 digits. No field or space to add notes or extensions or addresses. You can store up to 100 contacts on the SIM card and up to 200 on the phone, but there is no way that I have found to add contacts other than manually typing them on the keypad.The Walrus is great to hold and fits comfortably in my hand. It was very easy to start up: I simply inserted the T-Mobile Micro Sim card and the 8GB MicoSD card from my old phone into the Walrus, inserted the battery, plugged it in to charge and turned it on. I had no issues with connection to my service provider and it had as-good or better reception than my old phone.The Walrus has an easy to read display and had very crisp sound when making calls. It has a very loud speaker and I find it easy to hear it ring at mid-volume. It allows for .mp3 format ringtones so I was able to plug it into my computer and copy ringtones from the computer to the phone and use them. It took multiple attempts but I got the Walrus to pair with my Motorola hands-free device and so far no issues. The .mp3 music player is simple but works ok. It took multiple attempts to figure out what folder name the Walrus required on my MicroSD card to recognize my music files and the Walrus manual was no help, but I finally figured it out by copying the folder names in the Walrus to the MicroSD card. The Walrus music player lists songs alphabetically by file name - that is the only option. You can scroll backwards or forwards but if you have 500 songs and want to listen to song #250 in the middle your only choice is to scroll through 249 to get to it.","6","Helpful"

"Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB White (US Warranty)","Sony","399.99","5","Amazing phone! It's probably the best Sony phone I ever owned. I upgraded from Z2 and no regrets at all.Lime gold color is very beautiful! I was tired of black phones and decided to try something new. I even bought transparent case to enjoy of the color. It looks really really good. Got compliments from people.It's so nice to hold it in my hand. The size is just perfect for me. Every time I touch the screen, it feels awesome! Rounded edges is a big plus.Performance is solid and free of lagging. 32GB storage is okay, but you get much less of free space. 3GB of RAM is good.Fingerprint sensor is a very useful thing. However, you will have to install a firmware from another region to enable it (do it on your own fear and risk! I do not recommend you to do this). They locked the sensor in US version as you may already know.What else to say? Camera is okay. I was not able to test it a lot, as I don't care that much about camera, but it's definitely nice to have 13mp frontal camera. Flash light of the rear camera is stronger that was on Z2. I use bank app to deposit checks and it's hard to take a good picture of check when you don't have enough light around. Flash is strong and it makes checks too light and hard to read.Reception is good. Nice to finally have band 12, it really helps with T-Mobile. Wi-Fi connection is solid and didn't give me any headaches.Battery could have been better. Have to charge everyday. Might be something with Android Marshmallow? I remember I had pretty long battery life on Z2 with Lollipop. After update to MM, battery life significantly reduced and I had to charge it everyday (every 2nd or even 3rd day on lollipop).--------------------------------------P.S.

(hint get prepaid sims available in most major cities) And this option is a lot cheaper than having to pay international roaming charges. Another plus is that you are not tied to a network so you can switch whenever you like.Price. I think this is one of the cheaper phones which has touch screen capabilities without having a contract (of 2 years usually) and no data plan required. This was 350 USD when I bought it and has gone down to 300 (as nokia is trying to put out a newer model)Cons:As with other reviews, the plastic battery cover needs to be a lot sturdier. It bends easily as it is made of softer plastic (maybe to prevent it from cracking or becoming brittle?)Thicker dimensions. Not as sleek as an iphone as it is NOT an iphone.Apps for it is still limited, but expect it to grow over the years.","7","Helpful"

It's got two SIM card slots so yours should probably fit. The camera is bad, the screen becomes white or reflective if you're not looking at it head on, and there's almost zero device memory( I downloaded three apps) although you can use an sd card.Typing without Swype is hard because the touchscreen isn't very precise, and you have to download Swype, because I didn't see it already there.The ear buds it came with are unusable.Pros:I like the phones designService is ok.(at&t)It's a full on Android, so you can use the phone as a mobile hotspot, which I was not expecting.It came with a screen protector, wall plug, charger, and ear buds.Battery life is great.All in all pretty good. For the price it's a pretty good phone. I don't use my phone a lot, but mostly for texting and tethering, which this does. The last phone I had was the galaxy s3 which would not hold a charge. This is just aa short term phone for me, but I could probably use it long term with an sd card, since I use my iPod more.This is no galaxy phone, but it gets the job done at an ok price.","7","Helpful"

"Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty)","Sony","499.99","4","Since most others have already reviewed the major specs, I'll just touch on the two features that I was the most curious about but no one else seemed to review.Camera speed: So I'm a pet parent, and as every pet parent knows, shutter speed is extremely important when it comes to catching that oh-so-cute face your pup or kitty (I have both) are making at you before they ruin it with a yawn or getting distracted by a squirrel. My last phone (Galaxy SIII) was super quick at taking photos, even if they were blurred from the motion. I decided against the Xperia Z5 compact because of all the reviews on the slow camera speed. The X Compact appears to load the camera much quicker than what I saw in videos for the Z5 Compact, especially if you load by double clicking the power button. (it's a slower load via the dedicated camera button.) The shutter speed, however, is quicker than my husband's Xperia Z3 flagship, but still slower than my Galaxy S III. Even so, the auto focus does act pretty quickly, and it seems quicker the better the lighting is. The picture quality is pretty good, though, except that the colors are on the bluish side in dim lighting.Speakerphone quality: How is it 2016 and speakerphone quality is worse than before?! Maybe it's a Sony problem. Husband's Z3 is barely audible on speakerphone, and the X Compact made only slight improvement. It's audible when it's dead quiet around you, but less so when I'm walking the dog outside, and near impossible when I'm in the car. What's the big deal about these front facing speakers if I can't hear the other person very well?! (note: speakers seem to be great for playing videos and games.)Phone still gets 4 stars because of all the other nice features everyone else had already reviewed. But wanted to share about those two points since they are not often talked about.","7","Helpful"
"Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (GOLD) - International Stock No Warranty","Samsung","472.49","5","Switched from iPhone's iOS to Android and thought I'd try Sony's Z5, best decision ever! The phone arrived in 2 business days, put on the extra screen protector and an ultra-thin case (both purchased through Amazon), switched my SIM card over and it worked right out of the box. I noticed later that I wasn't able to setup Exchange mail for my work and the solution was to take it in to my carrier i.e. TMobile and have them enter their setup/configuration in the phone and this fixed all other lingering issues (as far as communication is concerned). The resolution on this thing is out of this world (I didn't realize it had a 4K screen until colleagues and friends who looked at the display marveled at the sharp and crisp display).I'm still getting used to Android 5.0 though (6 is not available for this phone yet, but soon is the rumor). I haven't found a push to talk button, but installed Dragon and it somewhat works like Siri.So far, the phone is a beast, worth every penny. The charger though takes forever to charger, I purchased an additional Sony charger on Amazon: OEM Sony Micro USB Charger (EP880+EC803) and this charges the phone much faster so maybe the Z5 shipped with a cheaper charger, I don't know.Anyway, I'm happy with this phone and purchased additional memory in case I need it,","7","Helpful"

"Huawei E5151 21 Mbps 3G Mobile WiFi Hotspot with Ethernet Port (3G in Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa & T-Mobile USA)","Huawei","160.21","4","When traveling internationally where 3G is available, and you need internet access without USB sticks and installing drivers (you may have devices which don't have USB like tablets and smart phones) - this is a great little device which can be used as a WAN access point with 3G, or LAN access point with Ethernet.One benefit of a separate self-powered device is you can keep it next to a window or somewhere there's a strong consistent 3G signal, while you and your laptop sit where you want. The rechargeable battery lasts a good 5 hours. They don't provide a charger, just a micro-USB port which can be used for charging it.A Huawei app available for iOS and Android can help set it up and manage it. It seems to be self-configuring for the most part. Based on the SIM card, it discovered the GSM 3G provider and its APN. The one thing I had to configure was the DNS server, before I could access the internet. If you download the app to your phone, it can be used for some undocumented functions such as putting the device in power-saving mode, where it will turn itself inactive if the 3G isn't accessed for some configured number of seconds.The Ethernet port on this device is a nice plus - if there is a single Ethernet cable available providing internet connectivity and several people need to use it (such as in a meeting) you can use the device to allow people to share that Ethernet via wifi. Up to 10 people can get on the wifi. If you don't need the Ethernet, there are cheaper models of this device you can buy.The wifi signal is strong within the same room, and drops to half-strength as you move to the next room. There is a pre-configured SSID and password (network encryption key) which is noted on the inside of the battery cover, and which can be changed.Overall a useful little thing to have with you if you need cheap internet access overseas over a period of time, and you have the ability to obtain a SIM card charged with a pre-paid data plan.","7","Helpful"

I liked my Z1 and don't have any complaints other than that it died so quickly. I decided to try something a little bigger and newer. I choose Xperia X because the camera promised to be great and overall performance. However, it turned out to be very disappointing. The quality of pictures are very poor. The images are not sharp, instead they're quite blurry regardless of the settings. In addition, the phone battery life is terrible, I used it for a short time to test pictures and video - battery went from 100% to 30% and the phone overheated. On another day, I used it very lightly - only checked emails few times and took few pictures - the phone battery went from 100% down to 20% by evening (I didn't add any apps and didn't run any games). I also need to mentioned that color is not truly pink as shown on the internet. It actually a very light copper color, more like a new penny color - not pink at all. I am returning this phone back and will look for something that provides better quality pictures and has a longer battery life.I ordered a new phone, but the package arrived as if it had been opened and used before. It's possible that I was sent a used, defective phone, despite me paying for a new phone.Please post if you've experienced similar issues with your phone.","8","Helpful"

"Sony Xperia Z5 E6683 32GB Gold DUAL SIM - Factory Unlocked - GSM International Version - No Warranty by Sony","","376","5","I upgraded from Xperia z2 to this Dual Sim z5. Im very happy with this purchase. It was a logical upgrade as most of everything is the same- however Sony has made decent upgrades. the exposed charging port is 100% better then the old hidden under a flap on the side of the phone. Also the Finger print reader works flawless and is hidden under the power button on the side. Speed and performance wise ill say the Snapdragon 810 is a mild improvement then the Snapdragon 801 in the z2. I have noticed the phone gets much warmer when i have it doing tasks such as backups or downloading larger files while doing other tasks as surfing the web. However being a water resistant phone cooling it off is as easy as running cool tap water over the front and back of the phone. Battery life has also been more or less the same. I can get a full days of use without much issueUsing the Dual sim feature is awesome as i dont need to carry 2 phones around. this phone also makes it easy to switch between sims 1 and 2 without physically handling the sim cards.","9","Helpful"

"Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked Phone - Midnight (1-Year U.S. Warranty)","","249.99","4","The Nextbit Robin is by far the most performant phone you can get brand new for the price, and the cloud storage for apps is interesting, if gimmicky. This review is for the Midnight model, though my wife owns the Mint one.The Specs: $200 buys you a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 SoC, 3GB RAM, a 5.2"" 1080p LCD covered by Gorilla Glass 4, 13MP/5MP cameras, front facing stereo speakers, a fingerprint sensor, and - unusually for unlocked phones in this price range - NFC, for using Android Pay.The Pros:SPECS. The specs above outperform every other phone in this price range, at least thanks to the Snapdragon 808. While most phones in this price range generally use octa-core Cortex-A53 parts - a core designed for efficiency over performance (for example, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 found in the Honor 5X or the MediaTek MT6753T found in the Blu Vivo 5R) - the Robin opts for a hexa-core Cortex-A72/A53 part, which uses four efficient A53 cores and two powerful A72 cores. It's a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, but the point is that on paper, the Nextbit Robin is a better performer than anything else in its class.REAL-WORLD PERFORMANCE. During day-to-day use, the phone does indeed perform very smoothly and can handle even gaming just fine.FINGERPRINT SENSOR. The fingerprint sensor is a nice thing to have, and since this phone runs Android 6.0 out of the box, it uses the Android fingerprint sensor API to allow simple authentication for apps like Android Pay and LastPass. Being side mounted thanks to doubling as the power button is a nice touch too, since it allows simple access while you're holding the phone without cluttering up the front or back of the phone.CAMERAS. The cameras can both take some decent shots - about what you'd expect from a phone in this price range, though, so temper your expectations.ANDROID SKIN. The skinning of Android is fairly light, opting to change the visual style more than seriously modify anything. This even means you have a Nexus/Pixel style System UI tuner if you hold down the Settings gear above the Quick Settings panel!NEXTBIT CLOUD STORAGE. The cloud storage works as advertised - all of your apps come back from cloud storage as though you never had them uninstalled in the first place.QUICK CHARGE. Quick Charge 2.0 helps alleviate some of the battery life woes (see below).DESIGN. This will be polarizing, but I think the Midnight Robin is gorgeous and the Mint Robin is adorable. The fact that it's flat on all sides seems like it would make it a hard phone to hold, but it's really nice in the hands.The Cons:BATTERY LIFE. This is an ""All day only with light use"" smartphone. There's really no sugar coating it. Even out of the box, battery life is pretty poor. Screen on time is only about 2 to 3 hours in my experience.FINGERPRINT SENSOR. It's fairly fast, but probably because of its small size, it's really sensitive to how you put your finger on it. If your finger is angled differently than it expects, it has a tendency to reject it.HEAT. The Snapdragon 808 is not a great chip. It gets very hot and has to switch to its more efficient cores fairly often. This means that the Robin can get uncomfortably hot if you're doing anything very taxing on the processor.BUTTONS. The volume buttons on the left side are hard to pick out on the side without a case. While I kind of like it now, the recessed power button/fingerprint sensor on the right side is easily confused with the also recessed SIM tray that sits below the power button.SPEAKERS. While a lot better than they were with the factory software, they still distort badly on high volumes. HTC BoomSound these ain't.CLOUD STORAGE. The Robin provides virtually no control over the cloud storage at all. Your apps get backed up, your photos (but not videos!) get backed up. You can't uninstall backed up apps until they're restored, either.NEXTBIT HOME. Like launchers on most Chinese phones, all apps are dumped onto your home screen. There is an app drawer, but it's fairly unintuitive to use. Better to dump it for something like Nova or Google Now Launcher.NO SD SLOT OR REMOVABLE BATTERY. The expandable storage on the Robin is limited to cloud storage, which is kind of depressing. Applying Nextbit's smart storage features to local storage would be outstanding. Also, carrying around spare batteries would help alleviate the Robin's battery life woes, but this battery is not removable.Overall, the Robin is a competent first attempt from Nextbit Systems. It's a beautifully designed, deceptively simple phone that ticks a lot of good boxes without too many bad. That all said, the cloud storage... is pretty gimmicky, and the mediocre battery life is frustrating. But it provides a nice glimpse into what we can look forward to from Nextbit.","9","Helpful"

"Samsung G850F Galaxy Alpha Factory Unlocked Cell Phone - Unlocked (Charcoal Black)","Samsung","622.9","5","This phone is great and I got it for a good price ($485). First I ordered the Samsung S5 mini (I wanted a smaller screen), but it was annoyingly slow. Alpha is much faster. It also looks much more expensive than S5 mini. It works great in the U.S. with AT&T. I don't doubt it will work in Europe too as it is the international version.I ordered from Big Apple Cellular and I am happy with them (it was fulfilled by Amazon though). They sent me a free case as a bonus. Although that's a nice touch, the case is awfully cheap. Who would put a phone for $500 in a case for $1...? But, yes, they tried. It was delivered exactly on the estimated delivery date which was 7 days after I ordered it. I felt like they are holding the shipment on purpose as it didn't ship until the night it was due to be delivered.Ordering through dealers on Amazon, I was also worried whether the phone is original. There are websites to check the phone's IMEI against a database. When you put in the IMEI, the database is supposed to show all the info about the phone - model, specs etc. When I put in my IMEI, I got info for a Nokia phone from 2005, so that was bad. Other websites couldn't find the IMEI at all. So I researched how best to test authenticity and it looks like it is through Samsung Kies. You can download the software on your PC and then connect the phone. If the software recognizes the device, then it's authentic. My phone was recognized! Phew! It is original.It is a really nice phone and looks very elegant. The back cover is much better than the Samsung S5 mini which looks super cheap. Especially the gold S5 mini...it's pretty bad in my opinion.I recommend Alpha!","9","Helpful"

"Samsung Galaxy Note 5 DUOS N9208 32GB Gold Platinum Factory Unlocked - DUAL SIM - GSM - International Version no warranty","Samsung","589","1","Very good phone with state of the art design and performance. However, quite fragile, slippery hold (you need to by a skin or case if you don't want to lose it) and close to non-resistant at all to any water exposure. Samsung happily refused to repair my unit (water spill damage) even when I proposed to pay for the repair. I had to go through three phone repairers to finally find one who wanted to give it a try, under the condition that I signed a disclaimer form saying he would not be liable in case he broke anything, the glass in particular.Personally, after the S6 complete lock followed now by this bad experience with the Note 5 (total: 1'500$) made me reconsider my adhesion to Samsung phones. I will prioritize buying from another manufacturer next. At premium price, this strategy is not acceptable: I would never have been denied repair service at an Apple shop, they would just have refused to cover it through the warranty, which I fully understand.You can trust the seller though, excellent contact, feedback and rapid answers to email questions. I just recommend buying another model.UPDATE 2016/02/13:Three phone repairers have now refused to open the Note 5 for fear of breaking its glasses/screen. I have also now been in direct contact with Samsung and offered to pay for the reparation (it only has a damaged microphone): Samsung refuses on grounds that the phone is an international model and only US carrier locked models can be repaired. I contacted a journalist and filed a complaint at the the consumer defense agency for the State of Massachusetts, more information might come soon.","10","Helpful"

I patiently went through three days of customer service calls to the ""support"" department of Virgin Mobile only to be told each time that the problem would be ""escalated"" the the appropriate technical department and would be fixed in 24 hours. For three successive days, I did this dance without resolution. Each time I called they would tell me that there was no record of my previous call or notation that the service request had been ""escalated."" I asked each time for a reference # or case number to follow up, but they said that they simply did not do this. On the 4th call, I was finally told that the problem would take between 24 hours and 6 DAYS to address.The final kick in the teeth was when I finally became fed up enough to switch to a different carrier, Virgin Mobile would not cancel my account... again promising to ""escalate"" the request for cancellation.

"Huawei Nexus 6P H1512 5.7-Inch 32GB Unlocked Cellphone, International Version (Black)","Huawei","350","5","What a Phone. Did a TON of research to choose between the Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, LG V10, and this phone. I was looking for an Android phablet that could work on both US (AT&T) and China (China Mobile) 4G. 4G knocked the LG V10 out. Price and design knocked the S6 Edge Plus out. When it came down to the Note 5 and the Nexus 6P, I did a lot of reading and it basically came down to camera and novelty. From all of the comparisons I've read, both have amazing cameras and the 6P has definitely proven itself to me. Coming from a Galaxy S4, the novelty of the 6P won out. The note 5 would have been more of the same. In my opinion, the fingerprint reader location and camera on the 6P beat the Note 5. Speaking of the fingerprint reader, I never thought I'd want to lock my phone. It's so easy though and works consistently well, that I've decided to use it. The only time it falters is with wet hands, but there's always the pin for backup. The 6P's regular operating system and security updates are a plus too. Having a Huawei phone for my time in China is another bonus. I can confirm the following: the H1512 international nexus 6P works well on both US AT&T 4G and China China Mobile 4G. The phone is super snappy. Who cares that there's not a 'clear all' apps button, this phone knows how to do memory management, you'll never have a need to manually clear an app from memory. The phone is also beautiful to look at with its AMOLED screen, and takes gorgeous still shots. I've already had a friend (who owns an S6) request that my phone be the one taking the group picture. Despite not having optical image stabilization, the electronic image stabilization does a great job with videos. I was a little scared jumping into the phablet arena, but it hasn't been a problem in the least. Even fits into my skinnier jeans. Is a real slim phone with a nice feel, I'd recommend the slimmest fitting spigen case, keeps the phone sexy while also keeping the glass off of surfaces and makes it easier to hold (it's too slim without a case). The 3450 mah battery lasts a long long long long time. I rarely end a day below 30% battery, and I'm often around 50+%. Fast charging is a godsend though most all new phones offer the same.Want me to pick a negative? It's panoramas; they're not great. Have yet to take one that doesn't have some odd clipping or shape, and some are just downright bad. Maybe panoramas on this phone work differently from phones I've had in the past and I just haven't figured it out.Couldn't be happier. I hope this phone lasts me a long long time.

It does, indeed, have video recording.A couple of things that I do not like about it: It doesn't have a slot for my memory card. I guess it was time to spring clean my photos and music anyway. Also, I tend to use text messaging for Twitter and Facebook, and I do get a lot of posts. I do not know if there is any way to delete multiple messages at once.

"HTC ChaCha A810E Unlocked GSM QuadBand Cellular Phone","HTC","269.1","4","The ChaCha is great... I knew what I wanted and this phone was perfect for me.. the QWERTY keyboard is nice big and spacy... The touch screen funcionalities are decent... With it 800GHz processador this phone is pretty decent and can handle anything as of now... I would only recommend this phone to ppl who like to txt, chat, of the like... Not a gamin phone at all... The down side which is a given or trade for the amazing QWERTY is the small size 2.4"" screen i believe it is... However the pixels this small size screen contains is beyond imagination packs the same pixels as high end phones... Due to it being a white phone... I recomend this to a clean freak type of guy... As well... Or else get a case for it... The other down side is that due it supporting such impressive screen, 3G, all means of chat and social networks... Drains the batteryyy very very hastely... So b ware of it.. it is a given that it will need to b charged every night... But if u use it more than avg it might require some charging durin the day...As of the supplier.. it was excellent...

"Verizon HTC Touch Pro XV6850 No Contract Phone","HTC","17.85","5","I've had this phone for a week now and it has been treating me VERY well. It may be because this is my first smartphone so i've upgraded from an LG Dare to this phone which is A LOT better. Reviews that you may find on youtube or anywhere else go over all the awesome features but there are also little things that make this phone great. It has unique light indicators that let you know when you have a notification (text, missed call, etc.) I read reviews that made me a little iffy about wanting to buy this phone, talking about how bad the battery life is and the reaction times, but that is just a matter of adjusting your backlight and using your task manager. Ending superfluous tasks will save your battery a whole lot and dimming your backlight will also help- my phone battery lasts on average about 16 hours (that's using the music player and camera for a short time and texting all day) so unless you're not going to be able to charge your phone for more that 16 hours you shouldn't have a problem with that if you know how to preserve your battery life. The phone looks very thick but does not feel thick in your hand or pocket so that isn't a problem either. Full slide-out qwerty keyboard is probably the best feature considering you sometimes have to use the stylus when you text using the touch screen because of how compact it is. Phone is a little laggy at times and can get somewhat frustrating but that's only if you try and rush the phone- if you give it a second or two to load it will load and then will function perfectly. The page also says this is a used phone and only includes phone, battery, and charger but it really comes in the verizon box completely brand new with PHONE, CHARGER, BATTERY, EXTRA STYLUS, AND INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS/CDs. Overall, this phone is a steal for the price of $75 and you will be very happy- unless of course you're downgrading from an iPhone or something like this, but if this is going to be your first smartphone i would very much recommend this phone. One last thing.. if you order from the ""fullfillment by amazon"" retailer it will take longer to ship because it ships from the retailer to amazon HQ and then ships from there to you, so it will take longer than usual to ship but it ships UPS from amazon which has the order tracking possibility so choosing the retailer is completely up to you.","13","Helpful"

I originally had Verizon and we had 3 techs try and get their sim to work on the Verizon network to no avail. By ""techs working"" on the phones I mean going so far as going into the settings a manually programming the network specs into the phone to make sure everything was correct. No such luck.AT&T: My next stop was to AT&T. I went directly to their local tech support office so that I would be dealing with their most experienced people. We were able to get the AT&T sim card to access the network but ONLY at the slowest Edge network speeds. Again, thru AT&T you will only get their slowest ""Edge"" network speeds. We did a speed test on the phone by accessing [...]on which we only got a max speed of 250+/- kpbs. Dismal speeds virtually rendering the phone useless on AT&T's network.T-Mobile: Next stop was T-Mobile. We we're able to get a T-Mobile sim to access their network but only at a maximum of 3G speeds Again, T-mobile WAS able to access their network but only at a max of 3G. NO 4G LTE. While 3G is better than nothing you will notice apps such a Waze have a difficult time centering your location and Waze and other mapping programs seem to have some difficulty getting your positioning right. *I had my iPhone 6plus right next to the Conquest S8 Pro on Verizon's network and it was working perfectly with all the apps that the Conquest was having slow network issues with.Sprint: Went to sprint. Sprint does not support these phones and does not provide SIM's to access their network.Boost Mobile: Same story at Sprint...they only provide service for their phones.So, long story short, or, TLDR; the BEST/ FASTEST speed's you will be able to achieve with this phone in North America will be thru T-mobile at 3G speeds.PHONE PHYSICAL REVIEW;The phone itself relating to it's rugged capabilities is as advertised. It is very rugged looking and feeling. I have a home scanner and tried out the internal walkie talkie and it works good The android system works good and the touch screen is responsive, bright and works with a gloved hand. One of the best features is the speaker boost which increases the external speaker volume to very loud levels....perfectly easy to hear over loud machinery.So why the one star review? Simple, this is a Smart Phone. We need these to be able to interact with the cellular networks of our local countries systems at their current levels. With the best speeds of only 3G available you are starting out behind the curve and will only get further behind as they are already working on 5g.If you are a North American (United States) prospective purchaser I cannot recommend this phone for you. Hopefully my trials and tribulations with trying to get this to work on the US Network will help save you some headaches.","13","Helpful"

Get a Sony Ericsson P910a.I was really lusting to have this phone. I viewed this phone as the ultimate in convergence of a PDA and a phone. However, when I started using the phone I found that it lacked many of the features of my T68i, which is a great phone.First, the software on the Treo 650 only allows incoming calls to be directed to the headset. When one makes an outgoing call you must dial the phone number then push the button on your headset to transfer the call. This is a major inconvenience when driving. I wrote to PalmOne about this and was told politely that this is the way their phone is designed to interact with a Bluetooth headset.Second, voice dialing is not an included feature. PalmOne endorses a third party voice dialing software that maxes out at 3000 contacts. Unfortunately, I have more than 3000 contacts in my PDA and I don't use voice dialing for all 3000. I only use voice dialing for about 40 contacts but this software is an all or nothing proposition. It doesn't allow the selection of specific contacts for voice dailing, which sucks. Although PalmOne does offer speed dialing on the Treo, it is a poor substitute for voice dialing, as I ran out of unique letters to assign to about 11 contacts.Third, the reception for this phone sucks. All places that my Sony Ericsson T68i works the Treo does not. In addition, the phone is very heavy compared to the Sony Ericsson 910a.I sold my Treo and replaced it with a Sony Ericsson P910a. The Sony Ericsson P910a is the upgrade I was searching for. It is my Sony Ericsson T68i with a PDA and camera.","14","Helpful"

There were also dead pixels and a very noticeable light spiderwebbing underneath the glass, kind of as if it had been dropped and the LCD was damaged.

One of these was the camera app which clearly showed the face of another person in there room. This phone was clearly used and damaged by the previous owner.

It is also fast and fluid and the battery lasts forever. The camera, though not a Galaxy-beater, is passable in bright settings.Yes, I got over the EMUI interface. I loaded Nova Launcher and life was good.But... There is a fatal flaw.Although the device has all the necessary LTE bands for use in America, and although it will upgrade (to a point) after you do your first upgrade using the OTA method, the device's ""location code"" automatically sets to ""International General"" after the first OTA upgrade. (Look for the C900 in the Firmware version number.) From there on out, the only way you can upgrade the device is to manually download a different regional ROM image, unlock the device, edit the config files deep inside the OS that control the region code, and then manually side-load the ALT-ROM. Since I must use a program that requires my phone to remain locked, I could not complete the process. Upgrading would have meant erasing my phone each time, and I cannot do that without incurring anger from our corporate IT team.Go in with your eyes wide open and you may be satisfied.

I ordered and paid for the phone because I needed a ""NO CONTRACT VERIZON PHONE"" to replace one my mother-in law broke. She is currently on my Verizon account, and I am currently under contract with Verizon. The model number and ESN tag on the phone Global Distributing sent me is obviously not the original tag, and has been replaced at some point in time. Regardless Verizon cannot activate phone, and says the tag on phone actually identifies it to be a Motorola phone.I have tried repeatedly and futilely to contact Global Distributing at (208) 391-5347 (phone number is number published under seller's information, and is also number given to me by Amazon's customer service).

"(LANDVO) 5.0"" Capacitive Touch MTK6582 Quad Core Android 4.2.2 3G Phone 512MB RAM 4GB ROM 2MP CAM WiFi GPS - Black","HTM","69.99","5","Keeping in mind that this is a sub $100 phone that has generally been advertised as the ""cheapest quad-core phone,"" the Landvo L800 has turned out to be a good phone that has exceeded my expectations. From all my research, Landvo seems to be a new company and the L800 was their first model which they released in March of 2014. I took a risk (although less than $100 isn't a huge risk) in buying this in April with no reviews available. The main thing I was looking for was the most powerful, inexpensive phone at the $100 price point. Battery life was also a major factor. So I purchased this phone on the basis of being the only phone in the price range at the time with a quadcore processor and also because it sports a 2300mah battery which was about the largest battery at the price point of the available models.There were a lot of things I immediately liked about the phone. Despite the low resolution and lack of IPS, the screen is pretty crisp and the viewing angles are more than decent. The battery life has also been good--as I have been averaging two days of average use on a full charge. One day of heavy use would usually put me around the 30% range which still isn't bad. I also was almost shocked by the build quality. The phone is heavier than most name-brand competition in its size class but it has a weighty, solid feel too it. The sides are metal, as are the volume rocker and power button. There are no creaks and everything fits together tightly. Fit and finish is top notch. I believe the screen is plastic and not glass, however. Their are pros and cons to this as a plastic screen is susceptible to scratching. However, it does mean that I will never have to worry about a cracked screen if I drop the phone. The phone came with a screen protector prefitted on the phone and an additional one in the box. The included silicone case is relatively simple but was also a nice touch, especially owing to the fact that a no-name brand phone is unlikely to have third party support for cases and such.However, I would not have recommended this phone to anyone at the time. Why? Because performance was lackluster. The quadcore SoC is quite snappy however, the small 512mb of ram was suffering on Android 4.2.2. I was wary of purchasing a phone with less than 1gb of ram and I was regretting it at this point. It would freeze and stutter during even the simplest tasks such as hammering out a text. I put forth my best efforts to streamline my system as much as possible to keep it running smoothly but the fact was it just didn't have enough ram to power Android comfortably. I was ready to ditch the phone for something new.I have completely changed my tune, however, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone in a heartbeat. Why? Surprisingly, Landvo has supported with releasing an official 4.4 KitKat rom for the phone. For those who are tech savvy, this is a boon. KitKat was actually streamlined by Google so that devices with only 512mb of ram can run it comfortably (4.2 was a bit of a resource hog). At this point, I figured I had nothing to lose--I was planning on dumping the phone anyways. Needless to say, flashing to KitKat made a world of difference. The performance is literally night and day as upgrading to 4.4 literally got rid of *all* the lag I was experiencing with the phone. It is now quite fast--I would argue faster than my Sero 7 Pro tablet which is running the old but venerable Tegra 3 processor. Demanding, apps load quickly without stuttering. Animations are smooth and everything has become a joy to use with this phone.If you are looking for a ridiculously cheap, but fast 5.0"" Android phone with good battery life and good build quality, this is the one you are looking for hands down. It's not going to compete with TOTL phones out there but for a measly $95, you shouldn't be expecting that. What you get is a perfectly usable phone at an almost throw away price. I've noticed vendors selling the L800 with Android 4.4 already installed so it looks like the new stock of this phone has been upgraded. If you are not tech savvy and comfortable with flashing your phone, make sure you purchase one with 4.4 already installed! You will love it if you do.","16","Helpful"

"BLU Jenny TV 2.8 T276T Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ 1.3MP Camera - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Red","BLU","20.99","3","This is a nice basic phone.On the PROS side, you'll find:- 2 line slots + 1 microSD slot- TV watching and FM listening (by the way, the phone has a deploying antenna, just like an old radio, my friends make a lot of fun of this feature)- Good GSM reception, speak and listening clarity.- Easy to use torchOn the CONS side, I'll list:- Very limited memory, the microSD is only useful to keep your pictures and music that can be transferred to and from your computer via the supplied USB cable.- You can only register one phone number by contact, forget about anything else like email, street address, notes, etc.- Very basic camera (1.3Mp with flash)- No MMS capability means you cannot send the pictures / videos you have taken.- No volume rocker makes it hard to control phone rings (only through settings), call or TV listening volume. Surprisingly, you may control the volume of the FM radio with both * (down) and # (up) buttons.- There is no way you can lock the keyboard, and when I put the phone in a pocket I may find that it was turned off (by pressing the ""hang up"" button for more than 2 seconds).Because all the drawbacks and limitations, I would normally have given only a one-star rating to this phone, but when I take the price paid into account, I can go up to a three-star rating.Nevertheless, I think BLU could have done a little effort in polishing this tool.","17","Helpful"

The selfie camera comes with native beauty photo mode which pretty much can do a lot of cool thing to your face and body, not that I ever going to use it.

I own MotoX Pure Edition and Samsung7. The phone was slowing down after a couple day use without rebooting, while my other phones could go days and week without reboot and no decrease performance.

"Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty","Huawei","399.99","5","So I'm kind of a gear nut, in the last 2 years I've gone through: HTC One M8, One Plus One, LG G4, Nexus 6P and now the Huawei Honor 8. My first foray into the Huawei product line was the 6P and honestly I was pretty impressed at what has been coming out of China with regards to affordable Android Devices.Let's get one thing straight, this is an iPhone 6 rip off ALL DAY LONG. From the design of the phone, to the look and feel of the OS, this thing stops just short of saying iPhone on the back. That said, the design is super clean, the back glass looks amazing and the phone is quite the little performer. I've been using this as my daily driver and the performance of the camera is really what sets this device apart from the other phones I've carried. The quality of images in good lighting conditions is phenomenal, especially when I consider I only paid $350 for the phone. Applications are snappy and function just as well as on my Nexus 6P, although I don't game much so YMMV. You can find reviews all over YouTube for this phone that will tout all the goods and bads, and I will say there are some weaknesses, lack of T-Mobile WiFi support is my only real disappointment!Battery life is great, especially for a 5 inch phone. The included quick works great, although it would have been awesome if it supported Qualcomm quick charging! Fingerprint sensor is actually faster and more responsive than my Nexus 6P and my wife's iPhones 6 & 7. If you're looking for an inexpensive 5 inch phone that has an amazing camera and performs well, check out the Honor 8.","17","Helpful"
"Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - White - 16GB - U.S. Warranty","Motorola","249","2","Let me say that my initial response to this phone was great. I thought Motorola had an affordable phone with a lot to offer. The performance was great to begin with but soon dropped.....a lot. Keep in mind I have only had the phone for a month. Every single app that I close out of says ""Unfortunately, *app name* is not responding"". Then it gives the option to report the issue or just say OK. It was an infrequent occurrence at first but now its all the time. There was time when my phone said ""Android UI is not responding""......pretty ridiculous if you ask me. The only fix I've found is to shut the phone down for a little while and start it back up, usually that gives a decent amount of screen time. Also, my phone operates extremely poor once the battery falls below 30%, which isn't a low amount of battery. And when I try to operate the device while being charged it's extremely sporadic. I'm not saying this is a common problem and am here to bash Motorola for this piece of junk I received, I'm just telling my experience. I'd like to give my review of this phone's specs but so far I haven't had the chance to try them out since I had about a full week in proper working condition. Not to mention some of the clips on the back cover snapped off when I was taking my SIM card out to place it into another phone. Not real impressed.","17","Helpful"
"Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mineral Black (US Warranty)","Sony","649.99","3","The Xperia XZ is truly a beautiful device. While the ""slab"" appearance my turn some people off, it's very comfortable to hold, and is narrow enough that it never feels like it's about to fly from your hand. The display, while not mind-boggling in terms of specs, borrows heavily from Sony's television expertise, and looks more ""natural"" playing HD movies than the iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S7 Edge.Sound quality, while maybe not quite to BoomSound's bar on earlier HTC devices, is also surprisingly good. It may not be the ""best"" Android device I've used for media consumption, but its the most enjoyable.Signal quality is something of a mixed bag. In places where other phones have marginal LTE coverage, I noticed the Xperia would drop to 3G more often than not. In places with stronger LTE coverage, I was seeing results like this when comparing with the same SIM:OnePlus 3: 32mb down / 8mb upGalaxy S7 Edge: 33mb down / 8mb upiPhone 7 Plus: 35 down / 7mb upXperia XZ: 27 down / 4mb up(Tests were run multiple times, and results are rounded and averaged.)The digitizer is nice and accurate, with almost perfect sensitivity. And throughout the device, there are numerous design cues that took me back to the Clie series of PDA's back in the long-long-ago. Even the no-needle-necessary SIM/SD tray is a welcome addition. You really do get a sense that this phone is ""expensive"" and attention was paid to every detail.Except one.This should all point to a higher rating, but the disappointing and deal-breaking discovery for me is that Sony chose to disable adoptable storage (at the time of this writing, there's not very extensive coverage of the phone, so this may be a more obvious deficiency in the future). I knew out of the gate that this only has 32GB, but with the inclusion of MicroSD support and every other ""nice"" feature of the phone seems to imply that it would just be there. It isn't, and enabling it over ADB doesn't work. So out of the box, with only software updates to the preinstalled apps and two weeks worth of my GMail account, 40% of the internal storage was already spoken for.While that might be acceptable for many, the second shoe dropped when it came to using the SD card as a media repository. Playback of Sony's own demo movies from the card (A Class 10 SanDisk Ultra) were choppy, and the transfer speed was dramatically slower than in my S7 Edge. My guess here is for whatever reason, Sony decided to go cheap here.And that, sadly, is why I'll be returning the phone. Were it not for that awful decision, it would be hands-down the best Android device I've used.","17","Helpful"

"ZTE Z431 Unlocked GSM Phone with 2.4"" Display, 2MP Camera, QWERTY Keyboard, GPS, SNS Integration, Muisic Player and microSD Slot - Black","ZTE","21.8","4","I purchased this phone for several reasons and it has proven to be a great purchase. First, I needed a new MP3 player that was rechargeable, played for at least 12 hours per charge and would handle free library Overdrive books. My small clip-on Sansa disk players were great while they lasted, but completely unreliable. After the 6th $40 player quit after only a couple of weeks I gave up on them. I also needed a prepaid phone that would allow me to text with ease, but discovered that a prepaid plan for a smart phone was always at least $10/mo more, even if I never used data. I have a tablet and don't need an expensive smart phone too. With the unlocked Z431, for $30 I was getting a good MP3 player, a phone that made texting easy and only had one item to carry with me instead of two. In addition, this phone has bluetooth so I was able to ditch the earbuds with cords that kept getting in the way. I can use the phone for talking and playing books for several days without having to charge it (never done that with a smartphone). The phone was AT&T unlocked so I could get a free Sim from PureTalk USA which has a unique plan allowing me to pay as little as $10/month for minutes or automatically adds blocks of time if I need more, with extra minutes rolling over. I use anywhere from 200 to 800 minutes a month so this flexibility means I don't run out, and don't pay for minutes I never use as I did on a previous StraightTalk plan. The phone/media player is not perfect (hence 4 stars}. I wish it played wma as well as mp3 format books, but since most are available in both formats can live with that. A 5-star phone would also have a sleep timer and flashlight.Adding books was a definite learning process so I am including the steps to doing that here.1) You must purchase and insert a memory card.2.) Download the software and Overdrive books to your computer using your library site.3.) Connect the phone to your computer via USB and wait for Windows to load drivers4) Go to Computer to find the player symbol under Players with Removable Storage and double click5) A window with ""U Drive"" should pop up. Single click (important) on U drive.6) Wait for a couple of minutes - it takes time to load and I was sure it was not working the first few times I tried it because I did not wait long enough. The first file menu that pops up is for the phone, when a second longer menu appears you will be able to use the Overdrive transfer option from your computer to get the files on to your phone.These steps were from my Windows 7 computer.Other things I like:The calendar with audio reminders of my appointments.The keyboard that I find easy to use in spite of the tiny keys. Maybe it works because the keys are raised. The numbers are small, but since most of the phone numbers I call are stored, I rarely have to enter a phone number.","24","Helpful"

"Lumia900 Factory Unlocked Smartphone with Windows Phone 7.5, 8 MP Camera, 4.3-inch Touch Screen, 16 GB Memory and Wi-Fi - No Warranty - Black","Nokia","288.88","5","This phone is absolutely fantastic for the price, but some potential buyers may not be fully aware of what to expect when it arrives.First off this phone is actually an unlocked AT&T Lumia 900, so there will be AT&T branding on the front. This means that the original packaging will already be opened, as the seller needs to manually unlock the phone before they ship it to you. This does NOT mean that it is a used phone. In order to be able to use non-AT&T sim cards, it is necessary for the seller to contact AT&T to receive an unlock code that frees it from the AT&T network. In my order, there was hardly any sign that it was handled at all, except for maybe a little finger print on the front glass. All the essential documents from AT&T and Nokia were inside the box, as well as a SIM ejector tool and a power cable.As is stated in the description, this phone will work on any HSPA/WCDMA 850/900/1900/2100 MHz/Quad-band data network and any GSM/GPRS/EDGE: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz cellular network, which in turn opens it for carriers in Europe and some in Asia. For US providers, there are currently only 2 major carriers that have GSM networks: AT&T and T-Mobile. There are other smaller carriers that offer services, but they utilize AT&T and T-Mobile towers in their coverage. These carriers include Straight Talk, Red Pocket Mobile, i Wireless, etc., and offer really affordable prepaid plans that I myself utilize. T-Mobile also offers a $30 a month prepaid plan that is rather reasonable.Unfortunately this phone will not work on any CDMA networks, which rules out Verizon, Sprint and US Cellular. For more information on the differences between CDMA and GSM networks, PCMAG.com has a fairly easy to read article explaining the differences between the two.Now onto the phone itself. I must say that I love this phone. It has a fairly decent Amoled 4.3 inch display, with a resolution of only 800x480. In our modern age of 1280├ù720 and above screens that may seem rather paltry. While using the phone normally it is looks as good as any other screen, but when watching YouTube videos it's lack of pixels becomes apparent. For me I use my iPad and laptop for watching videos so it doesn't matter to me all that much, but for others it may be a deal breaker.The build of the phone is absolutely fantastic. It is made of a solid polycarbonate body that is very resistant to scratches, with a screen made of Corning Gorilla Glass. Needless to say, it is very sturdy. The screen also seems to attract a large number of fingerprints as well, and for some reason is not all that easy to clean off. There is even a YouTube video where a hammer, saw and nail are taken to it and it comes up with little or no damage. The only thing on the phone that seems to be somewhat damageable is the metal piece around the camera lens. After less than 24 hours, there were already little scratches visible. For me I don't really care too much about it, but for others it may be really irritating.The camera itself is 8 megapixels with a Carl Zeiss lens, and it is just ok. There are certainly better phone cameras out there, with the iPhone 5 and Lumia 920 blowing it out of the water. For me it works best outdoors, as indoor shots tend to have more noise for whatever reason.This phone uses Windows Phone 7.5 Mango, so it is not the brand new Windows Phone 8. Sad thing about this phone is that it will never receive an update to Windows Phone 8. The hardware is just unable to fully handle the new OS. Instead it will receive Windows Phone 7.8, which gives it some Windows Phone 8 functionality, such as resizable tiles and the like. But apps in the future will cater just to Windows Phone 8, meaning that those with 7.8 and below will be left out in the cold with newer apps. Again, this isn't a deal breaker for me but for many it will be.One of the things that attracted me to this phone is Nokia Drive. Unlike most smartphone map applications, it does not require data in order to run. Before you set out on a trip you download fully detailed maps onto your phone, and then the built in GPS chip is used to map your location on the map. You can even download state or country specific maps, so you save space by not downloading the entire US map pack. All of this is done without data usage, which is great if you are traveling abroad. Oh, and it is completely free of charge. For travelers like myself, this is an awesome feature. I am also a student, so having a mobile version of Microsoft Office in my pocket is absolutely wonderful, for it allows me to edit documents while on the go.Overall this is a fantastic phone but definitely shows its age (close to one year). However, its awesome build quality as well as fantastic applications for travelers made it a must have for me. It fits my needs well, but potential buyers will need to consider whether it will work well for them.","28","Helpful"

I haven't gotten the device soaked yet but it is fast, runs cool, and the display looks great even in direct daylight. Didn't get outrageously warm and the battery life looks like it will outperform what reviews led me to expect. I didn't really care about or want the finger print scanner so I am not torn up about that. The phone itself is understated ""chic"" I suppose. Its solid in the hand, has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused here.I am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone. resolution and quality of output are on par with an HTC One M8. The M8 has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a Tidal account on the go. Has enough power to drive the Shure Srh-1840 to uncomfortable levels. Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device.","32","Helpful"

"Sony Xperia Z3+ (Z3 Plus) E6533 5.2-Inch 32GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone Dual Sim - International Stock No warranty (Copper)","Sony","300","4","So I purchased this one from Perfect Trading Inc, and it arrived in a seal pack condition. Though I had to waste half an hour to set up as it came in with all defaults set and that too in some Chinese language. Therefore I had to find my way through language settings and then restored it. Doing that allowed me to get to all the initial settings as it should prompt for when you turn it on for the first time. Along with this the charger that came with it was European plug. The nice thing about this was it came pre-installed with screen protector. Plus it also had Sony ear-phones in the box. Also to all who are curious; Yes it does HEAT a lot and drains battery heavily. In order to take care of the heating issue, Sony has disabled 2 cores of CPU in the OTA update, hence making it very similar to SnapDragon 805 and 801. But the heating issue is still there after the update as well.","40","Helpful"
"ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe 5.5-inch 4GB RAM, 64GB storage Unlocked Dual SIM Cell Phone, US Warranty (ZS550KL-Glacier Silver)","","399","5","This review is for the 5.5"" Zenfone 3 Laser, since there seems to be some confusion about which product people are reviewing. I bought this phone to replace a Moto G 4G (XT1045). This phone is a great deal at the $200 price point, and I have not found any major issues with mine.- SoftwareBefore I received this phone I was ready to write off the stock ASUS apps as worthless bloatware, but I'm happy to have been proven wrong. There are actually some usefull apps included stock that were not included with my previous phone Moto G, such as a file manager, flashlight app, laser ruler, and sound recorder. The Mobile Manager app is actually useful for managing battery and performance, keeping other apps in check. The battery drain notification is especially useful since it can let you know about an offending app early, instead of suddenly finding that your battery is in the red and you have no idea why. I haven't looked at any of the stock social or support apps yet. Some people have complained about wanting to remove stock apps, but I personally don't see much point. They don't auto-run so they aren't using any battery, and with 32GB of internal storage + 128GB uSD I am not exactly short on space. Note that this phone does not appear to support 'adoptable storage'. I'm not sure why they removed that feature from stock Marshmallow, but fortunately I didn't plan on using it anyway.- UII wasn't really sure what to expect from ZenUI having not been hands-on with an ASUS device before buying this one. Every vendor seems to be obsessed with differentiating through their UI, for better or worse. I figured worst case I could flash this phone over to Cyanogenmod in the near future if I hated the stock skin. However, I am happy to report that ZenUI looks and feels a lot like stock Android. People who are used to Samsung's TouchWiz may not like it. After using the Moto G for 2 years I had no trouble at all switching to this. I like that the flashlight and calculator are accessible from the pulldown menu on the lock screen without having to enter my passcode. However, I baffled that Power Boost (kills backgrounded apps to save memory) and Auto-start Manager (controls which apps can auto-start) are also accessible in this manner, as these are not apps that I would want a stranger to mess with. That's my only complaint about the UI.- BuildThis is my first phone >4.5"". I'm a fan of the larger screen when using it, but definitely not a fan of trying to bend over to pick things up while this is in my front pocket. With that said, the phone is very lightweight for its size. It is definitely lighter than my wife's Moto G 3rd gen despite having a larger screen and higher capacity battery. That does give me some concern about long-term durability, but so far I have no had any issue. External case material is metal, though I suspect this is just a shell over plastic since it does not feel or sound solid when tapped on with a fingernail. The ends of the phone contain the antennas and are encased in plastic. I generally hate phone cases and do not use them, but in this case the phone is slippery enough that I opted for a low profile rubber case from CoverOn. I definitely recommend this case to add some protection without adding much size.- ScreenThe screen looks amazing. It is bright and sharp. 1920x1080 is absolutely enough pixels for a screen this size. I have no complaints about this aspect of the phone.- CameraThe camera is great compared my Moto G, although I guess that isn't saying much. It's not like I'm looking for a replacement for my SLR, so to be honest my expecations weren't very high. I'll upload a few photos at a later time, but I'm sure you can find many other sample images in reviews elsewhere.- SoundThe phone has a single speaker on the bottom end. It would have been nice to have a second speaker on the top end for stereo in landscape mode, but that's asking a bit much for this price point. I see some reviewers have complained about it being quiet, but that has not been my experience. I keep my phone volume set 1 or 2 clicks up from silent and can easily hear it ringing on my desk from across the office at work. I suspect that those reviewers received defective units. The headphone jack, earpiece, and Bluetooth output are all in-line with what I experienced from my Moto G. I also have not had any trouble with lag during music playback like other users have reported. I use the phone every day to listen to music from the uSD card and it works great.My only complaint here is actually with the vibration; it is too subtle to work as a notification on its own. My Moto G would vibrate loudly enough that I didn't really need a notification tone. With this phone that is not the case.That's all that comes to mind for now. If I think of anything else, or if my experience changes significantly, then I will update my review accordingly.","40","Helpful"
"Apple iPhone 6s Plus 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone w/12MP Camera - Rose (Certified Refurbished)","Apple","599","4","I have had my certified refurbished Unlocked iPhone 6s Plus 128GB for about two weeks now and am very pleased. The phone arrived quickly and came in a plain white box with a charger (no headphones, but I didn't expect any). I almost returned it because it was labeled a ""Verizon"" iPhone, but I popped in my AT&T sim card and it worked like a charm (LTE worked too). The back of the phone was flawless, but I noticed some minor scratches on the screen. They are not noticeable when the screen is on, so it doesn't bother me. Plus I knew I was getting a refurbished phone and not a brand new one, so the scratches didn't surprise me too much. The battery life on the phone so far is fantastic. I am able to go two days without charging my phone. I was worried about the battery being in poor shape, but it is working great. If you're on the fence about buying one of these certified refurbished phones, I say go for it. The price is great. Just don't expect a spotless phone. Anyone who looks at my iPhone does not notice the scratches and thinks it is brand new. It is only when you get up really close and examine the screen that you notice minor scratches.","42","Helpful"

"Nokia Lumia 930 International Version No Warranty Unlocked Black","","208","5","I have had this phone for over a month and used it on my 19 day European vacation. I have to tell you that it's the BEST phone I have ever had. The pictures it takes are amazing. The living images combined with the storyteller app really just blow your mind. A still photo says a lot but adding the movement you get with living images adds that extra dimension to really convey the feeling of the subject matter. I highly recommend this phone to anyone living in the US even though you won't get full 4G since it's designed with European LTE bands and not the US bands. I happen to be connected to WiFi the majority of the time so it's not an issue for me. I have ATT and I just had to have the sim card cut to nano size and insert into the device. If you do this do not advise ATT that you switched devices. They will want the IMEI # and since it isn't designed or the US you may have connection issues. Just insert the nano SIM and you will be good to go!! Everyone who saw this phone in action wanted one.","44","Helpful"
"LG K7 unlocked smartphone, 8GB Black (U.S. Warranty) with SanDisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC UHS-I Card with Adapter, Grey/Red, Standard Packaging (SDSQUNC-032G-GN6MA)","","79.99","3","I really like this phone and it is working well. Good features, easy to use. However, I have a rather strong complaint about how the phone is advertised and its setup. It is NOT an unlocked phone out of the box. It is a T-Mobile pre-paid phone. The cryptic directions taped to the box were no help. Clear directions for unlocking the phone need to be given. The ""unlock"" utility is found in the folder of T-Mobile apps. You, the user, must run the app to unlock the phone and then - and only then - can you proceed with connecting the phone to your preferred cellular provider. The phone comes with a T-Mobile SIM card. You may need a SIM card from your preferred provider to get the phone connected to the provider's network.","45","Helpful"
"Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Yellow) - Sprint","Apple","233.43","5","Iphone 5c is basically an Iphone 5 with a colorful plastic case which makes it about a $100 cheaper (regular Iphone 5 and 5s is metal and plastic). Outside of the colorful plastic you really won't notice the difference between this, the iphone 5 and the iphone 5s unless you're REALLY knit picky. I'm a Samsung guy who stayed away from the Iphone for years due to the small size of the phones, I decided to try this one out because of the price and that it is relatively similar in size to a smaller Samsung phone like the Galaxy Victory I had before and it hasn't been that big a deal to switch over (so far).I wanted to take the time to address some of the negative reviews regarding purchasing these phones as many come from user error. If you're going to buy a used phone from a 3rd party vendor be sure to read the description of the phone on that specific venders profile and not the Amazon listed one (which is for a new phone). The one I bought was refurbished but the vender (mybullfrog) listed specifically what it came with (charger and cable), the condition of the phone (near great condition with perfect screen) and what it didn't come with (a sim card). Putting that together basically this phone was a warranty exchange because the previous owner dropped it and cracked the screen and they just replaced it for them with a new phone, fixed the screen on the other phone and is reselling it. I got it exactly 3 days from when it was shipped and it was exactly as described (picture included).When you buy a used phone with a sim card already in you run the risk of getting a phone that won't be able to be activated as that phone could possibly still be active on someone else's account (a regular complaint on low scored reviews).When you buy a phone without the Sim you have to get the Sim from the network provider of the phone (in this case Sprint). If you don't know this information it can be a hassle which accounts for most of the complaints. If you go to a corporate Sprint store (IE a store that does in store phone repairs) they do carry Sim cards there and shouldn't charge you for them if you're activating the phone at their store (though they're less than $4 if they do). If you just go to a regular Sprint store generally they won't have spare Sim cards and will look at you funny.Anyway so far so good, I checked everything out, got phone calls, sent and received texts, watched TV on aps, used the headphone jack and it all worked perfectly. So far no complaints from me.","54","Helpful"

"Apple iPhone 5s 64GB Gold - AT&T","","399.95","3","I purchased this product because it was listed as ""New"". It has worked well, but the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge as well as I thought a new product's battery should. The initial battery charge I made seemed to take almost a full 24 hours, much longer than I thought it would take. I took the phone to the Apple Genius Bar tonight to run a diagnostic on the battery and the result was disappointing. The diagnostic indicated the battery was working properly, it also indicated that it had been connected to a charging device more than 500 times, which the genius bar tech said was not a ""new"" phone.","62","Helpful"
"Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Rose Gold)","Apple","908.99","5","If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)","75","Helpful"

When I bought it, my mom almost didn't let me, because she thought since it was so low priced, it would be bad. DO NOTE, THAT THE SELLER IS RAISING THE PRICE, AND I BOUGHT MINE FOR $204 ABOUT A WEEK AGO. NOW IT WAS $245.So I am saying, if the price goes down, GO FOR IT.There are two SIM card slots, so you can add extra memory, and not worry about having not enough space.Imagine.. 128GB of storage space.. The possibilities are ENDLESS!Also, the processing speed is flawless, you can play games on there as well as any other.The camera works well, if you are expecting a g7x camera in a phone then that's your problem. It's just a phone.But a REALLY great thing about this phone- it has front camera flash! Amazing! A Samsung Galaxy s5 doesn't even have that.It comes with 16GB memory, which is excellent for a phone, you can actually do stuff.Another good thing-This phone doesn't load you up on extra apps, only one page! it does come with a folder with Microsoft word, PowerPoint, etc. but that can just be deleted. I'm talking about undeletable apps.TO ALL YOU T-MOBILE USERS, YES! IT WORKS WITH T-MOBILE!you can use 4G LTE or 4G with T-Mobile and you can use data outside, and make calls, texts, etc.This is a fully functioning phone.It is almost as big as a Samsung Galaxy note 4 , only smaller by about a centimeter, and it's as a big as an iPhone 6+. Ayye.The screen is amazingly clear, and the brightness is phenomenal.The sound quality is really good, and unless you want to blast music around the entire city, the sound volume suffices.The RAM is 1.5GB, which is really good for a $204 phone.The phone doesn't heat up at all, and it maintains a steady room temperature, no matter how much you used it.When my phone arrived, it was definitely new. It had never been opened, and there was still plastic protectors on the screen and on the side. Not a smudge.The battery was wrapped up nicely out of the phone, and it came with 50 percent charge in it. This lasted me all day!It DID come with a charger and earbuds, but the charger was universal. ITS OKAY THOUGH , because it came with a peice to match the wall sockets. This could be seen as a plus, though, because this means that you can use this charger around the world. You can also use the phone itself around the world, too since its international!The earbuds came a little wonky.. One earbud chord size was was much to short, but it's okay, because it was generous to even include earbuds in the first place.OOOH OOH AND THE THEMES!!!YES!!!They're amazing! You can use themes to change the ENTIRE look of your phone. It changes the font, the s Rene color and pattern, and even the looks of the applications and. Decorates the insides of the apps. The keyboards could look different, and you could have clouds instead of chat bubbles in the messaging app, with a tebddy bear pink background. Ooh.There are also MANY themes for free. They do have payed ones, but you can find NO problem at all finding ten really cute free themes.This phone does work in America!Have FUN with this phone.This phone really is unlocked, so you can use any carrier.Go buy this phone now, and have no doubts in your head, because it is AMAZING.-Pictures attachedP.S I lost the black part for the charger that turns it into a normal charger but yes, it does come with one.
